public class CustomMetricWidget : IDashboardWidget
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string WidgetId { get; set; }
    public object Content { get; set; }
    
    public void Refresh()
    {
        // Update widget data
    }
    
    public void Initialize()
    {
        // Setup widget
    }
}
```

### Registering a Widget

```csharp
dashboard.RegisterWidget(
    new CustomMetricWidget 
    { 
        WidgetId = "custom-metric",
        Title = "Custom Metric"
    }
);
```

## Extension Guide

### Creating Dashboard Extensions

Extensions can add new tabs, tools, or features.

**Extension Structure:**
```
MyExtension/
├── MyExtensionViewModel.cs
├── MyExtensionView.xaml
├── MyExtensionView.xaml.cs
├── Resources/
│   └── Icons/
└── manifest.json
```

**manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "id": "my-extension",
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "Extension description",
  "targetVersion": "3.6.0",
  "entry": "MyExtension.MyExtensionView"
}
```

### Loading Extensions

1. Place extension folder in `%AppData%/Helios/Extensions`
2. Restart Dashboard
3. New tab appears automatically

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Reduce History Retention** - Keep only recent data
2. **Enable Selective Logging** - Only log necessary events
3. **Use Sampling** - Sample metrics instead of capturing all
4. **Close Unused Tabs** - Reduces background processing
5. **Adjust Refresh Rate** - Lower refresh interval for faster data
6. **Monitor Process List** - Terminate unnecessary processes
7. **Optimize Memory** - Use Memory Profiler to find leaks

---

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Check dashboard daily for anomalies
2. **Baseline Metrics** - Record normal operating metrics
3. **Alert Configuration** - Set appropriate thresholds
4. **Log Retention** - Balance detail vs. storage
5. **Backup Data** - Export critical metrics regularly
6. **Theme Consistency** - Maintain visual coherence
7. **Documentation** - Document custom extensions
