# PHASE 6: COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY & INTEGRITY PROTOCOLS

## CRITICAL: Computer Safety Guarantees

### Principle: ZERO RISK TO SYSTEM INTEGRITY
**"No breaking changes. No system bricks. Fully reversible."**

---

## Section 1: Pre-Installation Safety Checks

### 1.1: System Requirements Verification
```
BEFORE ANYTHING TOUCHES THE SYSTEM:

✓ Windows version compatibility (7, 10, 11 only - verified per OS)
✓ Available disk space (minimum 2GB free, warn if <5GB)
✓ RAM minimum (2GB minimum, warn if <4GB)
✓ .NET Runtime compatibility (verify 8.0+ present)
✓ Admin privileges check (warn if running as non-admin)
✓ Antivirus/Windows Defender compatibility
✓ BitLocker/Encryption check (warn user)
✓ System drive integrity check (no corrupted sectors)
✓ Registry health check (validate key locations)
✓ Windows Update compatibility
✓ Pending system restart check
```

### 1.2: Conflict Detection
```
✓ Port availability scan (check if ports 5000-6000 free)
✓ Process scanning for port conflicts
✓ Existing HELIOS installation detection
✓ Conflicting services detection (IIS, SQL Server, etc.)
✓ Firewall rule conflicts
✓ Antivirus exclusion requirements
✓ Group Policy restrictions check
```

### 1.3: Pre-Flight Diagnostic Report
```
Generate comprehensive diagnostic before installation:
- System specs (CPU, RAM, GPU, SSD/HDD, Network)
- Current driver versions
- Windows Update history
- System event log warnings
- Available resources
- Network connectivity
- DNS resolution
- All stored as diagnostic_TIMESTAMP.log
```

---

## Section 2: Completely Isolated Installation

### 2.1: Installation Directory Isolation
```
Installation paths (ZERO overlap with system):
  C:\Program Files\HELIOS\          (isolated, not system-critical)
  NOT: %SystemRoot%, %WinDir%, %System32%
  
Registry isolation:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\HELIOS\      (separate hive)
  NOT: Critical system keys
  
Database isolation:
  %APPDATA%\HELIOS\                  (user-specific)
  NOT: System databases
  
All paths:
  - Fully configurable before install
  - User can choose installation drive
  - Separate from Windows system files
```

### 2.2: Clean Uninstall Verification
```
Uninstall will:
✓ Remove ALL HELIOS files and directories
✓ Remove ALL Registry entries (with whitelist preservation)
✓ Remove ALL Start Menu shortcuts
✓ Remove ALL Desktop icons
✓ Restore firewall to pre-installation state
✓ Remove all scheduled tasks
✓ Clean Windows event logs (optional)
✓ Leave ZERO remnants in system

Verification:
✓ Registry scan post-uninstall
✓ File system scan for orphaned files
✓ Confirm all ports released
```

---

## Section 3: Complete Rollback & Recovery

### 3.1: Automatic Pre-Installation Backup
```
BEFORE installation begins:

1. System State Snapshot
   - Registry export (HELIOS-related keys)
   - Firewall rules export
   - Hosts file backup
   - Current process list
   - Network configuration
   - Installed software list
   - All stored in: %APPDATA%\HELIOS\Backups\PRE_INSTALL_SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP\

2. Rollback Package Creation
   - Complete restore script
   - All original values
   - Registry rollback commands
   - Firewall restoration
   - Executable: Rollback_HELIOS_TIMESTAMP.exe
   - Placed on Desktop for easy access
```

### 3.2: One-Click Rollback
```
If ANY problems detected:

User can execute: "Rollback_HELIOS_TIMESTAMP.exe"
This will:
  ✓ Close all HELIOS processes
  ✓ Restore ALL Registry entries
  ✓ Restore firewall rules
  ✓ Delete HELIOS installation directory
  ✓ Restore previous state exactly
  ✓ Verify restoration complete
  ✓ Delete rollback exe after successful rollback

Zero user intervention needed beyond clicking one button.
```

### 3.3: Windows System Restore Integration
```
Installation creates System Restore Point:
- Before installation begins
- Labeled: "Before HELIOS Installation - TIMESTAMP"
- User can use Windows Recovery if needed
- Never disables System Restore
- Stored automatically by Windows
```

---

## Section 4: Strict File System Safety

### 4.1: Write Permission Verification
```
For EVERY file write operation:
✓ Verify target directory exists and is writable
✓ Check available disk space
✓ Verify no system files at path
✓ Create backup of existing files before overwrite
✓ Atomic writes (write to temp, then move)
✓ CRC32/SHA256 verification post-write
✓ Rollback capability for every write
```

### 4.2: File Deletion Safety
```
NEVER delete files without:
✓ Moving to recycle bin (NOT permanent delete)
✓ Logging deletion with timestamp
✓ 30-day retention in Recycle Bin
✓ Recovery instructions provided
✓ Verification that file is HELIOS-only
✓ No system files ever touched
```

### 4.3: Registry Safety
```
Registry modifications:
✓ Only in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\HELIOS
✓ Backup before every modification
✓ Never touch SYSTEM, SECURITY, or critical keys
✓ All changes logged to installation.log
✓ Verify registry integrity post-write
✓ Rollback capability for each change
```

CPU protection:
- Per-service CPU throttling
- Global CPU percentage limiter
- Temperature monitoring
- Thermal throttling if needed

Disk I/O protection:
