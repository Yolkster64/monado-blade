# Microsoft Purview Integration for HELIOS Platform

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Enterprise Ready

## Overview

Microsoft Purview provides data governance and compliance for HELIOS:

- **Data Governance**: Catalog, classify, and manage data
- **Compliance**: Monitor GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 compliance
- **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate data risks
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow and dependencies
- **Insider Risk**: Detect anomalous user behavior

## Data Governance

### Data Catalog

HELIOS data assets registered in Purview:

- SQL Databases: helios-db-prod, helios-warehouse
- Data Lake: blob storage containers
- Power BI Reports: Dashboards and reports
- REST APIs: Published endpoints
- File Shares: SharePoint and OneDrive

### Data Classification

Classification hierarchy:
```
Public (Green): Non-sensitive
Internal (Yellow): Company only
Confidential (Red): Restricted
Highly Confidential (Purple): Maximum security
```

## Compliance Monitoring

### GDPR Compliance

Requirements tracking:
- Data Subject Rights (export, delete, port)
- Data Processing Agreements with vendors
- Privacy Impact Assessments
- 72-hour breach notification
- Data retention policies

### HIPAA Compliance

HIPAA controls implemented:
- AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS in transit
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Role-based access control
- 6-year audit log retention
- Data integrity validation

### SOC 2 Type II

SOC 2 requirements:
- Security: User access controls
- Availability: Uptime metrics and backups
- Processing Integrity: Data accuracy
- Confidentiality: Encryption and access controls
- Privacy: Data handling procedures

## Data Lineage

Track data flow through HELIOS:
```
Data Sources
├── APIs (external integrations)
├── Databases (on-premises)
└── File uploads (users)
    ↓
ETL Processing
├── Data validation
├── Transformation
└── Enrichment
    ↓
Data Warehouse
└── helios-warehouse (SQL)
    ↓
Analytics & Reporting
├── Power BI dashboards
├── Reports
└── Exports
```

## Insider Risk Management

Detect potentially risky user behavior:
- Unusual data access patterns
- Large downloads outside business hours
- Access to sensitive data outside role
- Failed login attempts
- Policy violations

Policies can be configured per department/role.

## Implementation

### Enable Purview

1. Create Purview account in Azure
2. Grant permissions to data sources
3. Register data sources (databases, data lakes, etc.)
4. Create classification rules
5. Configure compliance policies
6. Set up alerts for violations
7. Enable insider risk policies

### Create Data Classification Rules

Use patterns to auto-classify:
- Credit card numbers (regex matching)
- Email addresses
- Social security numbers
- API keys and passwords
- Medical record identifiers

### Configure Compliance Policies

Set rules for:
- Data retention and deletion
- Access controls
- Encryption requirements
- Audit logging
- Breach notification procedures

## Dashboard

Monitor compliance status:
- Overall compliance score (%)
- Assets by classification
- Policy violations
- Risk indicators
- Audit trail

## Next Steps

1. Plan data governance strategy
2. Identify all data sources
3. Create classification scheme
4. Register assets in Purview
5. Configure compliance policies
6. Setup monitoring and alerts
7. Train team on data governance
