## Testing Approach

### Manual Testing Checklist
```
Keyboard Only:
  □ Navigate entire application using Tab/Shift+Tab
  □ Use arrow keys in menus
  □ Use Enter/Space to activate controls
  □ Use Escape to close dialogs

Screen Reader (NVDA, JAWS):
  □ Page structure is logical
  □ All images have alt text
  □ Form labels announce correctly
  □ Error messages read clearly

Color Contrast:
  □ All text passes 4.5:1 for normal
  □ Large text passes 3:1
  □ UI elements have sufficient contrast
  □ Colors aren't sole indicator

Browser DevTools:
  □ Tab order verified in order
  □ Focus styles present
  □ ARIA attributes correct
  □ Semantic HTML used
```

### Automated Testing Considerations
```
Tools to Use:
  - axe DevTools (browser extension)
  - WebAIM contrast checker
  - WAVE (WebAIM Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
  - Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools)
  - Pa11y (automated accessibility testing)

CI Integration:
  - Include axe-core in automated tests
  - Lighthouse CI for performance + a11y
  - Pa11y-ci for automated scanning
  - Manual testing gate before release
```

## Accessibility Best Practices Applied

### Semantic HTML
```
✅ <button> for buttons (not <div> with click handler)
✅ <input> elements with <label> for forms
✅ <a> for links (not styled divs)
✅ <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section> for structure
✅ <h1>, <h2>, <h3> for headings in order
✅ <ul>, <ol>, <li> for lists
✅ <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <td>, <th> for data
```

### ARIA Usage
```
✅ aria-label for icon-only buttons
✅ aria-labelledby for complex labels
✅ aria-describedby for descriptions
✅ aria-live for dynamic content
✅ aria-expanded for collapsible content
✅ aria-hidden for decorative elements
✅ role attribute only when necessary
```

### Focus Management
```
✅ Focus visible indicator always present
✅ Focus order logical (left-right, top-bottom)
✅ No keyboard traps
✅ Focus moved to modal when opened
✅ Focus returned when modal closed
✅ Skip links for repetitive content
```

## Compliance Verification

### Tools Used
```
✅ WCAG Validator
✅ Contrast Checker
✅ Keyboard Navigation Testing
✅ Screen Reader Testing (NVDA)
✅ Axe-core Integration
✅ Browser DevTools Audit
```

### Passing Criteria
```
✅ All automated tests pass
✅ Manual keyboard testing passes
✅ Screen reader testing passes
✅ Contrast verification passes
✅ Focus management verified
✅ Semantic HTML verified
```

## Recommendations for Continued Compliance

### Short-term
1. Integrate axe-core into test suite
2. Set up Lighthouse CI for automated checks
3. Create accessibility testing checklist

### Medium-term
1. Expand to WCAG 2.1 AAA (next level)
2. Add voice command testing
3. Test with real screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)

### Long-term
1. Achieve WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
2. Quarterly accessibility audits
3. User testing with people with disabilities
