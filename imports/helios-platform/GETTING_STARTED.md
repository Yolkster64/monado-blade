## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I skip a phase?**
A: Not really. Phase 1 needs Phase 0, Phase 2 needs Phases 0-1, etc. They build on each other. BUT you can stop at any point. Most people stop at Phase 2.

**Q: How long does the whole thing take?**
A: About 15-20 hours of hands-on work spread over 4-6 weeks.

**Q: Can I undo changes?**
A: Yes. Each phase can be rolled back completely. System snapshots are created before each major change.

**Q: Can I add components later?**
A: Yes. Components are independent. Add AI Dashboard after Phase 2 if you want.

**Q: Is this safe?**
A: Yes. Each change is tested and can be rolled back. Snapshots created before each phase.
