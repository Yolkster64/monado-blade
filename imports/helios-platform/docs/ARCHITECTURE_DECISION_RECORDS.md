# HELIOS Platform - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Component-Based Architecture with MVVM Pattern

### Status
Accepted

### Context
HELIOS Platform needed a scalable architecture that separates concerns and enables independent component development while maintaining consistency across the application.

### Decision
We adopted a Component-Based Architecture with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern as the primary architectural approach.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: MVVM cleanly separates UI logic, business logic, and data
- **Testability**: ViewModels are easily testable without UI dependencies
- **Scalability**: Components can be developed and maintained independently
- **WPF Integration**: MVVM is the natural pattern for WPF applications

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved code organization, easier testing, better maintainability
- **Negative**: Requires more boilerplate code initially, steeper learning curve for new developers

## ADR-002: Fluent Design System Implementation

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The application needed a consistent, modern visual identity that reflects professional design standards and provides excellent user experience across all components.

### Decision
Implement Microsoft's Fluent Design System with custom HELIOS branding colors and extensible theme system.

### Rationale
- **Professional Appearance**: Fluent Design provides modern, polished UI
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility considerations
- **Consistency**: Unified color palette, spacing, and typography system
- **Extensibility**: Easy to customize for branding requirements

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Professional appearance, accessible components, consistent UX
- **Negative**: Initial development effort for design implementation

## ADR-003: Async/Await Pattern for Long-Running Operations

### Status
Accepted

### Context
HELIOS Platform performs complex cloud operations and data processing that could block the UI thread, degrading user experience.

### Decision
Use C# async/await pattern throughout the application, with ConfigureAwait(false) in library code.

### Rationale
- **Responsive UI**: Long operations don't block UI thread
- **Scalability**: Better resource utilization in high-concurrency scenarios
- **Modern C#**: Built-in language support with clean syntax
- **Exception Handling**: Naturally integrates with try-catch

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Responsive application, better scalability, clean code
- **Negative**: Complexity in asynchronous code flow, requires careful exception handling

## ADR-004: Dependency Injection for Service Management

### Status
Accepted

### Context
HELIOS Platform requires loose coupling between components, testability, and centralized service configuration.

### Decision
Implement Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (DI) container for service lifetime management.

### Rationale
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't depend on concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Easy to inject mock implementations for testing
- **Configuration**: Centralized service registration
- **Standardization**: Uses standard .NET DI approach

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better testability, reduced coupling, centralized configuration
- **Negative**: Additional complexity in container setup

## ADR-005: Toast Notifications for User Feedback

### Status
Accepted

### Context
User actions require immediate feedback without interrupting workflow. Modal dialogs are too intrusive for non-critical notifications.

### Decision
Implement toast notification system for success, warning, error, and info messages.

### Rationale
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't block user interaction
- **Feedback**: Provides immediate action confirmation
- **Stack Management**: Multiple toasts can be displayed simultaneously
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Toasts dismiss automatically after timeout

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better UX, non-blocking feedback
- **Negative**: Requires careful timeout and positioning management

## ADR-006: Semantic Versioning for Release Management

### Status
Accepted

### Context
HELIOS Platform needs clear versioning for releases, updates, and compatibility tracking.

### Decision
Implement Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0 across all releases.

### Rationale
- **Clear Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH communicates breaking changes clearly
- **Dependency Management**: Helps with package compatibility
- **Release Communication**: Easier to communicate changes to users
- **Industry Standard**: Widely recognized and adopted

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear version semantics, better compatibility tracking
- **Negative**: Requires discipline in version number assignments

## ADR-007: Console Output Formatting for CLI

### Status
Accepted

### Context
HELIOS Platform CLI requires clear, readable output for various operations, with visual distinction between success, warning, and error states.

### Decision
Implement standardized console formatting with colors and symbols for different message types.

### Rationale
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback for CLI operations
- **Consistency**: Standardized formatting across all console output
- **Accessibility**: Symbols in addition to colors for color-blind users
- **Professionalism**: Polished command-line experience

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved CLI UX, professional appearance
- **Negative**: Console output depends on terminal support for colors and Unicode
