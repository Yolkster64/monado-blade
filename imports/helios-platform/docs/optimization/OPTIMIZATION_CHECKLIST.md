# Optimization Checklist

**Version:** 1.0 | **Status:** Production Ready

---

## Pre-Optimization Assessment

- [ ] Document current baseline metrics
- [ ] Identify pain points
- [ ] Establish monitoring
- [ ] Get stakeholder buy-in
- [ ] Allocate resources

---

## Phase 1: GitHub Actions (Week 1-2)

### Setup
- [ ] Enable NuGet caching
- [ ] Configure build cache
- [ ] Reduce artifact retention (7 days)
- [ ] Compress artifacts

### Verification
- [ ] Measure build time reduction
- [ ] Track cost savings
- [ ] Verify cache hit rates
- [ ] Document results

**Expected Improvement:** 30% faster builds, $30/month savings

---

## Phase 2: Build System (Week 3-4)

### Configuration
- [ ] Update project files for parallel compilation
- [ ] Enable tiered compilation
- [ ] Configure assembly trimming
- [ ] Setup incremental builds

### Testing
- [ ] Build all frameworks
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify package creation
- [ ] Check artifact sizes

**Expected Improvement:** 45% faster full builds, 50-60% incremental

---

## Phase 3: Deployment (Week 5-6)

### Implementation
- [ ] Setup parallel pre-checks
- [ ] Implement artifact compression
- [ ] Optimize health checks
- [ ] Create deployment scripts

### Testing
- [ ] Test staging deployment
- [ ] Verify health checks
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Document procedures

**Expected Improvement:** 65% faster deployments

---

## Phase 4: Caching & Network (Week 7-8)

### Setup
- [ ] Implement response compression
- [ ] Setup CDN caching
- [ ] Configure client cache headers
- [ ] Implement request batching

### Verification
- [ ] Measure bandwidth reduction
- [ ] Track cache hit rates
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Verify compression ratios

**Expected Improvement:** 50-60% bandwidth reduction

---

## Phase 5: Monitoring (Week 9-10)

### Implementation
- [ ] Create metrics dashboard
- [ ] Setup alerts
- [ ] Configure notifications
- [ ] Document procedures

### Testing
- [ ] Verify metrics collection
- [ ] Test alert triggers
- [ ] Validate dashboards
- [ ] Train team

**Expected Improvement:** 70% faster issue detection

---

## Performance Verification

### Measurement Points
- [ ] Build time (baseline vs. optimized)
- [ ] Deployment time (baseline vs. optimized)
- [ ] Cost per build
- [ ] System reliability
- [ ] Developer satisfaction

### Documentation
- [ ] Before/after metrics
- [ ] Configuration changes
- [ ] Procedures and runbooks
- [ ] Team training materials

---

## Post-Optimization

- [ ] Monthly metric review
- [ ] Quarterly optimization planning
- [ ] Annual architecture review
- [ ] Continuous monitoring
- [ ] Team feedback incorporation

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Build time: 26 min → ≤15 min
- [ ] Cost reduction: 60%+
- [ ] Deployment time: 15 min → ≤6 min
- [ ] System uptime: ≥99.9%
- [ ] Team satisfaction: ≥4/5
