Users Impacted: 100%
Business Impact: Complete system outage
Recovery Window: 30 minutes
```

**Detection:**
```
Automatic Detection:
- Failed auth attempts: > 3 consecutive
- Auth request timeout: > 2 seconds
- Health check failure: Connection refused
- Error rate spike: > 50% of requests

Detection Latency: < 5 seconds

```

**Root Causes:**
```
1. Security Service Crash (40% probability)
2. Database Connectivity Loss (30%)
3. Network Partition (20%)
4. Certificate Expiration (10%)
```

**Recovery Procedure (Automatic + Manual):**
```
Phase 1: Automatic Recovery (30 seconds)
├─ Detect failure (5s)
├─ Activate secondary Security System (10s)
├─ Switch traffic to standby (5s)
├─ Verify health (5s)
└─ Resume operations

If Automatic Fails → Manual Recovery:

Phase 2: Manual Intervention (2-5 minutes)
├─ Operator receives alert
├─ SSH to security-primary node
├─ Check process status: systemctl status helios-security
├─ Review logs: tail -f /var/log/security.log
├─ Restart service: systemctl restart helios-security
├─ Verify: curl http://localhost:6000/health
└─ Confirm recovery

Phase 3: Investigation (during recovery)
├─ Check disk space: df -h
├─ Check memory: free -h
├─ Check DB connection: psql test
├─ Check logs for errors
└─ Document root cause

Full Recovery Time: 30 seconds (auto) to 5 minutes (manual)
Data Loss: None (state preserved)
User Experience: Transparent (auto) to 5-minute outage (manual)
```

**Rollback Capability:**
```
Rollback Procedure:
1. If secondary system faulty:
   - Switch back to original
   - Restore from backup
   - Verify functionality

2. If configuration caused failure:
   - Revert to previous config
   - Restart service
   - Verify operations

3. If data corrupted:
   - Restore from latest backup
   - Replay transactions from audit log
   - Verify data consistency

Rollback Time: 10 seconds (config) to 5 minutes (data)
```

**Data Consistency Checks:**
```
After Recovery - Verify:

1. Auth Token Validity
   - Verify issued tokens still valid
   - Check for token corruption
   - Validate signature integrity

2. Policy Consistency
   - Verify policies replicated correctly
   - Check no policy conflicts
   - Validate access controls

3. Audit Trail Integrity
   - Verify no audit logs lost
   - Check sequence integrity
   - Validate digital signatures

4. User Sessions
   - Count active sessions
   - Verify session state
   - Cleanup orphaned sessions

Verification Time: 2-3 minutes
Success Criteria: 100% consistency verified
```

### 1.2 High Impact Scenario: Build Agent Failure

**Impact:**
```
Severity: HIGH (P2)
Affected Systems: Build pipeline
Users Impacted: Build operations only
Business Impact: Cannot build/deploy
Recovery Window: 5-10 minutes
```

**Detection:**
```
Triggers:
- Build start timeout > 30 seconds
- Build process crash
- Artifact generation failure
- Resource exhaustion

Detection: Automatic within 5 seconds
Notification: Alert to Slack #builds
```

**Recovery Procedure:**
```
Automatic Recovery (60 seconds):
1. Detect failure (5s)
2. Queue build to another agent (10s)
3. Notify user (5s)
4. Retry compilation (varies)

If Retry Successful:
- Continue with rest of pipeline
- User sees "Retried on another agent"
- Build completes normally

If Retry Fails:
- Move to Phase 2: Manual Investigation
```

**Manual Intervention:**
```
Phase 2: Operator Intervention (5 minutes)

1. Assess Build Agent Status
   - Check build queue: curl http://build1:8080/status
   - List active builds: curl http://build1:8080/builds
   - Check resource usage: ssh build1 "top -bn1"

2. Determine Root Cause
   - No disk space?
     Action: Clean artifact cache
     Command: rm -rf /tmp/build-cache/*
   
   - Out of memory?
     Action: Restart build agent
     Command: systemctl restart helios-build-agent
   
   - Process hung?
     Action: Kill hung process
     Command: pkill -f "cc1plus" (C++ compiler)
   
   - Network issue?
     Action: Check connectivity
     Command: ping build-artifact-storage

3. Restart Build
   - Use "Retry Build" button in GUI
   - Or: curl -X POST http://gui:8000/api/builds/retry/{buildId}

4. Verify Completion
   - Monitor progress in GUI
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify artifacts generated
```

### 1.3 Medium Impact: Network Partition

**Impact:**
```
Severity: MEDIUM (P3)
Affected Systems: Inter-system communication
Users Impacted: Depending on partition location
Business Impact: Feature degradation
Recovery Window: 10-20 minutes
```

**Detection:**
```
Symptoms:
- Ping timeouts between systems
- RPC request timeouts
- Queue buildup
- Increased error rate

Detection: 10 seconds
Monitoring: Continuous ping monitoring
```

**Recovery Procedure:**
```
Automatic Response (30 seconds):
1. Detect partition
2. Fail requests fast (timeout < 1 second)
3. Queue requests for retry
4. Switch to degraded mode

Degraded Mode Features:
- Some features unavailable
- Requests queued (timeout: 1 hour)
- Partial functionality available
- User notifications shown

Manual Resolution (10-20 minutes):
1. Identify partition boundary
   - Run: traceroute system1 system2
   - Check: arp -a | grep {ip}
   
2. Restore connectivity
   - Network team action
   - Check firewall rules
   - Verify routing tables
   - Restart network interface

3. Resume Normal Operations
   - Retry queued requests
   - Clear request queue
   - Verify all systems online
   - Monitor for stability

```

**Detection:**
```
Triggers:
- Checksum verification failure
- Query result inconsistency
- Replication errors
- Constraint violations

Detection: < 1 second
Notification: CRITICAL alert + page on-call
```

**Recovery Procedure:**
```
Immediate Response (30 seconds):
1. Detect corruption

## SECTION 2: ERROR PROPAGATION & HANDLING

### 2.1 Error Cascade Prevention

**Firewall Pattern:**
```
System A
    ↓ (request fails)
Error occurs - CONTAINS error (doesn't propagate)
    ├─ Log error
    ├─ Increment error counter
    ├─ Retry locally (if applicable)
    └─ Return error to caller
    ↓
System B receives error
Error HANDLED - doesn't cascade
    ├─ Decide: retry, fallback, or fail
    ├─ If retry: implement exponential backoff
    ├─ If fallback: use cached/degraded response
    └─ If fail: inform user gracefully
```

**Timeout Configuration:**
```
Timeout Hierarchy (prevents cascading):

Level 1: Remote Call Timeout
├─ Default: 5 seconds
├─ Maximum: 30 seconds
└─ Fails immediately if exceeded

Level 2: Retry Timeout
├─ Max retries: 3
├─ Backoff: exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
├─ Total max: 7 seconds

Level 3: Request Timeout
├─ Total end-to-end: 30 seconds
├─ If exceeded: fail fast
└─ Prevent queue buildup

Benefit: Prevents cascading failures
Example: If system A is slow, system B times out
         and frees resources for other requests
```

### 2.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern

```
Circuit Breaker States:

CLOSED (Normal Operation):
- Request passes through
- Fail counter resets
- Monitor success rate

OPEN (Detected Failure):
- All requests fail immediately
- No attempt to contact failed service
- Start timeout timer

HALF_OPEN (Recovery Test):
- Allow test request through
- If succeeds: go to CLOSED
- If fails: go to OPEN

Configuration:
├─ Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
├─ Open timeout: 30 seconds
├─ Half-open test frequency: 1 request/10 seconds
└─ Reset on success: Yes

Benefit: Prevents system overload during outages
```

## SECTION 3: ROLLBACK CAPABILITIES

### 3.1 Code Rollback

```
Deployment Rollback Procedure:

Scenario: New version causes issues

Automatic Rollback (5 minutes):
1. Health check detects degradation
2. If error rate > 5%:
   - Automatically switch to previous version
   - Notify team
   - Log incident
3. Resume with stable version

Manual Rollback (2 minutes):
1. Operator decides to rollback
2. Deploy previous version
3. Verify health checks pass
4. Confirm with team

Zero-downtime Rollback:
- Blue-green deployment
- Switch traffic to previous version
- Downtime: 0 seconds
- Data: Preserved (no migrations undone)

Verification:
- Health checks: All pass
- Smoke tests: All pass
- Metrics: Return to normal
- User reports: Received and verified
```

### 3.2 Database Rollback

```
Data Rollback Procedure:

Scenario: Database migration corrupted data

Rollback Strategy:

1. Point-in-time Recovery
   - Restore to 1 hour ago
   - Replay transactions since
   - Exclude problematic transaction

2. Transaction Log Replay
   - Restore from backup
   - Replay good transactions
   - Skip failed transactions
   - Reapply corrections

3. Backup Restoration
   - Restore full database backup
   - Restore from 1 day ago
   - Replay transaction logs
   - Verify consistency

Time Estimates:
- Point-in-time: 10 minutes
- Transaction replay: 15 minutes
- Full restore: 30 minutes

Data Loss:
- Point-in-time: < 1 hour
- Transaction selective: < 1 minute
- Full backup: < 24 hours
```

## SECTION 4: DATA CONSISTENCY RECOVERY

### 4.1 Consistency Checks

```
Automatic Consistency Checks (hourly):

1. Database Integrity
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Unique constraint validation
   - Data type validation
   - Referential integrity

2. Replication Consistency
   - Master/slave sync check
   - Replication lag < 1 second
   - Binary log position match
   - Data checksum verification

3. Cache Consistency
   - Cache vs database comparison
   - TTL validation
   - Eviction policy check
   - Memory usage validation

4. Distributed State
   - All nodes have same state
   - Version consistency
   - Timestamp ordering
   - Event sequence validation

If Inconsistency Detected:
1. Log event with details
2. Trigger automatic recovery
3. Notify operators if critical
4. Generate recovery report
```

### 4.2 Recovery Time Estimates

```
Recovery Time by Scenario:

Scenario                          RTO         RPO
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Service restart                   30s         0s
Secondary failover               60s         0s
Database failover               5-10m       <1m
Backup restoration             20-30m       <1h
Full system rebuild            2-4h        <24h

RTO = Recovery Time Objective (how fast to recover)
RPO = Recovery Point Objective (how much data lost)

Targets:
- RTO: 15 minutes average
- RPO: < 5 minutes average
- MTBF: > 800 hours
- MTTR: < 15 minutes
```
