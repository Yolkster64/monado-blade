### Field Usage Statistics

- **Required Fields:** 3 (Priority, Component, Status Phase)
- **Optional Fields:** 22
- **Auto-Populated Fields:** 17
- **Manual Fields:** 8
- **Calculated Fields:** 0 (all manual or automated)

## Tier 1: Basic Tracking Fields

### Field 1: Priority

**Field Details:**
```yaml
Field Name: Priority
Type: Single Select
Icon: Flag
Field ID: priority_field
Required: Yes
Default Value: Medium
Options: [Critical, High, Medium, Low]
```

**Purpose:**
- Enable issue prioritization across backlog
- Determine work order and sprint inclusion
- Identify urgent vs. strategic work

**Usage Examples:**

| Priority | When to Use | Examples | SLA Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Critical | System down, security breach, major data loss | Security vulnerability, prod outage, data corruption | 1 hour |
| High | Important feature, significant blocker | Critical performance issue, essential feature delay | 4 hours |
| Medium | Standard feature, normal bug | Feature implementation, UI improvement | 1 day |
| Low | Enhancement, nice-to-have | Documentation update, minor UI tweak | 1 week |

**Automation Integration:**
- Used by Rule 4 to auto-assign tier (Critical → Enterprise minimum)
- Triggers in Priority-based board view sorting
- Influences sprint planning algorithms
- Used in notifications for escalation

**Best Practices:**
- Review priority weekly for accuracy
- Escalate if critical issues accumulate (>5 concurrent)
- Avoid overusing critical designation
- Document priority rationale for high items

- Component checkbox fields auto-checked when this field set
- Component-based board view populated automatically
- Component lead notifications triggered

**Usage in Workflows:**

```
Creating New Issue:
1. Select most relevant component

**Sizing Guide:**

| Points | Effort | Time | Complexity | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| **1 (XS)** | Minimal | < 1 day | Trivial | Typo fix, doc update, config change |
| **2 (S)** | Small | 1 day | Simple | Single function, simple UI fix |
| **3 (M)** | Medium | 2-3 days | Moderate | Module enhancement, feature addition |
| **5 (L)** | Large | 3-5 days | Complex | New subsystem, major refactor |
| **8 (XL)** | Extra Large | 1-2 weeks | Very Complex | Major feature, system redesign |
| **13 (XXL)** | Huge | 2-4 weeks | Extreme | Platform migration, new architecture |

**Point Estimation Process:**

```
Step 1: Read and understand requirements fully
Step 2: Consider dependencies and risks
Step 3: Compare to similar previous issues
Step 4: Account for unknowns (add 20-30%)
Step 5: Make team estimate in planning
Step 6: Discuss outliers (points > 2x average)
Step 7: Finalize with consensus
```

**Automation Integration:**
- Used in velocity calculations
- Rule 4: Issues with Effort >= 5 get Professional tier minimum
- Impacts capacity and sprint planning
- Used in team workload distribution

**Usage Examples:**

```
Issue: "Fix typo in README.md"
Estimate: 1 point (< 1 hour)

Issue: "Add dark mode toggle"
Estimate: 3 points (2-3 days including testing)

Issue: "Implement SSO authentication"
Estimate: 8 points (1-2 weeks with testing and docs)

Issue: "Platform architecture redesign"
Estimate: 13 points (2-4 weeks)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Estimate in team planning sessions
- Use reference issues as anchors
- Avoid cognitive bias (planning fallacy)
- Review actual time vs. estimate post-completion
- Adjust estimates for team velocity changes

## Tier 4: Resource Tracking Fields

### Field 20: Estimated Days

**Field Details:**
```yaml
Field Name: Estimated Days
Type: Number
Range: 0-365 days
Icon: Calendar
Required: No
Default: 0
Unit: Calendar days (not business days)
```

**Purpose:**
- Estimate calendar duration for task
- Enable resource scheduling
- Plan team capacity across days
- Communicate timeline expectations

**Relationship to Effort Estimate:**
```
Effort Estimate (Story Points):
  - Measure of work complexity
  - 1 point ≈ 1-2 hours dev work
  - Team velocity: 40-50 points/week

Estimated Days:
  - Calendar time needed
  - Includes planning, review, integration, testing
  - More realistic for stakeholder communication
  - Accounts for parallelization and dependencies

Conversion Formula:
  Estimated Days = (Points / Team Velocity) * 5 days/week + 1
  
  Example:
  - 8 points, 40 points/week velocity
  - 8/40 * 5 = 1 day development
  - + 0.5 days planning
  - + 0.5 days testing/review
  - + 1 day integration/deployment
  = 3.5 days ≈ 4 days estimated
```

**Usage Guidelines:**

| Scenario | Days | Formula | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| Quick fix | 1 | Points: 1-2 | Same day if started early |
| Feature | 3-5 | Points: 3-5 | Includes review and testing |
| Major feature | 5-10 | Points: 8 | Includes multiple phases |
| Complex system | 10-20 | Points: 13 | Multiple developer weeks |
| Platform change | 20+ | Points: 13+ | Requires coordination |

**Setting Process:**

```
Step 1: Determine effort in story points
Step 2: Convert to estimated days using formula
Step 3: Account for dependencies and blockers
Step 4: Consider team parallel capacity
Step 5: Add buffer for unknowns (10-20%)
Step 6: Discuss with team lead
Step 7: Finalize estimate
```

**Automation Integration:**
- Used for timeline and Gantt chart views
- Combined with start date for deadline calculation
- Influences resource allocation
- Used in capacity planning
- Impacts sprint scheduling

**Best Practices:**
- Keep between estimated days and actual effort consistent
- Review and update as work progresses
- Use historical data for calibration

- Business Requirement: Ship by 2026-05-15
- Start Date: 2026-04-15 (planning buffer)
- Target Date: 2026-05-13 (2-day buffer)
```

**Deadline Management:**

| Days Until Deadline | Status | Action |
|-------------------|--------|--------|
| > 7 days | Healthy | Monitor |
| 3-7 days | Yellow | Increase focus |
| 1-3 days | Red | Daily check-in |

IF Component IN (AI, Agents) THEN Tier = Professional
IF Component IN (GUI, Security) THEN
  IF Priority = Critical THEN Tier = Enterprise
  ELSE Tier = Professional
ELSE Tier = Professional

IF Priority = Critical THEN Tier >= Enterprise (minimum)
IF Effort >= 5 THEN suggest Tier >= Professional
```

**Manual Override:**

```
When to Override Auto-Assignment:
1. Tier conflicts: Choose highest tier
2. Cross-tier features: Assign to highest applicable tier
3. Strategic priority: Elevate tier if business critical
4. Customer-specific: Use Custom tier

Override Process:

2. Label Applied → Component Auto-Set
   Status: Auto-Tracked (tracking started)
   
3. PR Linked → Status Updates Begin
   Status: Auto-Updated (PR drives status)
   
4. PR Merged → Issue Auto-Closes
   Status: Full-Automation (complete automation)
```

**Metrics by Automation Status:**

```
Manual Issues:
- Count: 20% of total
- Cycle Time: 18 days average
- Effort: High manual overhead

Auto-Tracked Issues:
- Count: 30% of total
- Cycle Time: 14 days average
- Effort: Reduced overhead

Auto-Updated Issues:
- Count: 35% of total
- Cycle Time: 10 days average
- Effort: Low overhead

Full-Automation Issues:
- Count: 15% of total
- Cycle Time: 6 days average
- Effort: Minimal overhead

Goal: Increase Full-Automation to 40%+
```

**Automation Integration:**
- Updated automatically when rules trigger
- Used in automation efficiency dashboard
- Identifies process optimization opportunities
- Tracks automation ROI
- Supports continuous improvement

**Best Practices:**
- Apply labels to enable auto-tracking
- Link PRs to enable auto-updates
