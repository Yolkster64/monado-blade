# Security & Compliance Guide - HELIOS Platform

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** Enterprise Ready

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Identity & Access Management

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Enforce for all admins: REQUIRED
- Enforce for all users: RECOMMENDED
- Methods: Authenticator app (primary), Phone call (secondary)
- Remember device: 30 days for regular users, 7 days for admins

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
```
Principle: Least Privilege
- Admins: Only those who need admin access
- Operators: Can start/stop/manage resources
- Developers: Limited to development resources
- Viewers: Read-only access
```

**Service Principals**
- One service principal per application
- Use certificate-based auth (not secrets)
- Rotate credentials every 90 days
- Limit scope to required resources only

### 2. Network Security

**Network Segmentation**
```
Frontend Tier (Public)
├── Allow: HTTPS (443)
└── Allow: HTTP (80)

Application Tier (Internal)
├── Allow: Only from frontend
├── Allow: Port 8080 (app server)
└── Deny: Internet access

Database Tier (Private)
├── Allow: Only from app tier
├── Allow: Port 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL), 1433 (SQL Server)
└── Deny: All other sources
```

**Encryption**
- At Rest: AES-256 (Azure Storage Service Encryption)
- In Transit: TLS 1.2+ (enforced)
- Key Management: Azure Key Vault
- Certificate Rotation: Auto-renewed 30 days before expiry

### 3. Data Protection

**Data Classification**
- Public: Non-sensitive, shareable
- Internal: Company use only
- Confidential: Restricted access
- Highly Confidential: Maximum security (credentials, keys)

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**
- Block sharing of highly confidential data
- Require encryption for transit
- Audit all data access
- Alert on suspicious patterns

**Backup Strategy**
- Frequency: Daily
- Retention: 30 days (rolling)
- Location: Geo-redundant (2+ regions)
- Test Recovery: Monthly
- RTO: < 1 hour for critical systems

### 4. Endpoint Security

**Device Compliance Requirements**
```
Windows 11:
- BitLocker encryption: Required
- Windows Defender: Up-to-date
- Firewall: Enabled
- Screen lock: < 5 minutes
- Password policy: 14+ chars with complexity
- Updates: Within 30 days

macOS 13+:
- FileVault encryption: Required
- Antivirus: Third-party required
- Firewall: Enabled
- Screen lock: < 5 minutes
- Updates: Within 30 days

iOS/Android:
- Passcode: 6+ digits
- Encryption: Enabled
- App protection: Required
```

### 5. Monitoring & Logging

**Logs Retention**
- Application Logs: 90 days hot, 2 years cold storage
- Audit Logs: 2 years minimum (compliance requirement)
- Security Logs: 3 years (legal hold)
- Backup Logs: 7 years (disaster recovery)

**Real-time Alerting**
```
CRITICAL (Page on-call immediately):
- Database failure or unavailable
- All web servers down
- Data breach detected
- Authentication system down

HIGH (Email alert within 1 hour):
- Single VM failure
- High error rate (>5%)
- DLP policy violation
- Multiple failed login attempts (>10)

MEDIUM (Next business day):
- Disk space > 90% used
- Backup failed (but another exists)
- Old security patch available
- API slow response (but working)
```

## Governance Framework

### Access Control Levels

```
Level 0 (Super Admin):
├── Full subscription access
├── Can modify IAM policies
├── Can delete resources
└── Requires 2-person approval

Level 1 (Admin):
├── Resource group access
├── Can create/modify resources
├── Cannot modify IAM policies
└── Requires change ticket

Level 2 (Operator):
├── Resource-level access
├── Can manage instances (stop/start)
├── Cannot delete resources
└── Logged and audited

Level 3 (Viewer):
├── Read-only access
├── Can view metrics/logs
├── Cannot make changes
└── Minimal logging
```

### Change Management

**All changes must follow**:
1. Submit change ticket 24 hours in advance
2. Get approval from change advisory board (CAB)
3. Communicate to stakeholders
4. Execute during maintenance window
5. Verify success with post-change test
6. Document results

**Emergency Changes** (< 24 hours):
- Require VP-level approval
- Execute with caution
- Post-incident review required

### Audit Procedures

**Monthly Audits**:
