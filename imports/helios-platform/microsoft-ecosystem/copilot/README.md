## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Optimize Azure Deployment

**Prompt**:
```
I have a HELIOS Platform deployment in Azure with:
- 10 Standard_D4s_v3 VMs running 24/7
- 1 SQL Database (Standard tier)
- 500 GB storage in General Purpose account
- Current monthly cost: $8,500

Analyze for optimization opportunities. Suggest:
1. Cost reduction strategies
2. Autoscaling recommendations
3. Reserved instance opportunities
4. Architecture improvements
```

**Copilot Output**:
```
Cost Optimization Analysis for HELIOS Platform:

Current Costs: $8,500/month

Identified Opportunities:
1. Reserved Instances (3-year)
   - VMs: Save $3,420/month (40%)
   - SQL Database: Save $180/month (30%)
   - Total Potential: $3,600/month

2. Autoscaling Configuration
   - Off-peak shutdown: Save $1,200/month
   - Schedule-based scaling: Save $800/month
   - Total: $2,000/month

3. Storage Optimization
   - Archive old logs: Save $150/month
   - Geo-redundancy adjustment: Save $100/month
   - Total: $250/month

Estimated New Monthly Cost: $2,650/month
Annual Savings: $70,200 (82% reduction)

### Use Case 2: Security Hardening

**Prompt**:
```
Review our HELIOS Platform security configuration:
- Entra ID with MFA for admins only
- No conditional access policies
- Network Security Groups allow SSH from 0.0.0.0/0
- No Key Vault for secrets management
- Backup retention: 7 days

Provide security recommendations with priority levels.
```

**Copilot Output**:
```
Security Review - HELIOS Platform

CRITICAL (Address Immediately):
1. SSH Access from Internet
   Impact: Exposed to brute force attacks
   Fix: Restrict SSH to specific IPs or VPN
   Implementation Time: 15 minutes

2. Secrets Management
   Impact: Connection strings in code
   Fix: Implement Azure Key Vault
   Implementation Time: 30 minutes

HIGH (Address This Week):
1. Conditional Access Policies
   Impact: No risk-based access control
   Fix: Implement device compliance policies
   Implementation Time: 1-2 hours

2. MFA for All Users
   Impact: Only admins have MFA
   Fix: Enforce MFA organization-wide
   Implementation Time: 2-4 hours

MEDIUM (Address This Month):
1. Network Isolation
   Impact: No application segmentation
   Fix: Implement network security zones
   Implementation Time: 4-6 hours

## Integration Points

### 1. Teams Integration

Create a dedicated Copilot workspace in Teams:

```
HELIOS Platform Team
├── #copilot-analysis        → AI analysis requests
├── #copilot-scripts         → Generated scripts
├── #copilot-security        → Security recommendations
└── #copilot-optimization    → Optimization suggestions
```

### 2. Azure Integration

Copilot can analyze:
- Azure Monitor metrics and logs
- Application Insights data
- Security Center recommendations
- Cost Management insights

### 3. Documentation Generation

Generate automated documents:
- Deployment runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides
- Security policies
- Compliance reports

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include current configuration details
2. **Provide Context**: Explain business objectives
3. **Request Alternatives**: Ask for multiple approaches
4. **Verify Recommendations**: Review before implementation
5. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on responses
6. **Document Results**: Save useful outputs for future reference
7. **Review Security**: Ensure recommendations meet compliance
8. **Cost Validation**: Verify cost calculations independently

## Limitations & Considerations

- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Copilot has training data cutoff date
- **Verification Required**: Always verify recommendations independently
- **Real-time Data**: Can't access live metrics without copy-paste
- **Compliance**: Ensure sensitive data isn't exposed in prompts
- **Licensing**: Requires Copilot Pro or Pro Business subscription

## Privacy & Security

- **Data Protection**: Don't include credentials, API keys, or passwords
- **Export Data**: Copy-paste (don't upload files with secrets)
- **Compliance**: Review chat history for compliance/audit
- **Retention**: Conversations may be retained per Microsoft policy

## Getting Started

1. **Sign Up**: Visit copilot.microsoft.com
2. **Select Plan**: Choose Copilot Pro or Pro Business
3. **Explore Templates**: See PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md
4. **Start Small**: Begin with non-critical analysis
5. **Validate Results**: Independently verify recommendations
6. **Iterate**: Refine prompts for better results
