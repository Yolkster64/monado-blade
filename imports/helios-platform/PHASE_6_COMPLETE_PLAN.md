## Safety-First Architecture

### Core Safety Principles
1. **Isolation**: All changes in `C:\Program Files\HELIOS\` only
2. **Reversibility**: One-click rollback to pre-installation state
3. **Verification**: Every operation logged and verified
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous system health checks
5. **Transparency**: User always knows what's happening
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on 5+ Windows versions

### Safety Mechanisms (MANDATORY)
- [x] Pre-installation system diagnostics
- [x] Conflict detection (ports, processes, services)
- [x] Automatic pre-installation backup
- [x] One-click rollback capability
- [x] Windows System Restore Point creation
- [x] Runtime resource limits and monitoring
- [x] Crash detection and automatic recovery
- [x] Post-installation verification suite
- [x] 48-hour stability testing before release
- [x] VM-based destructive testing
