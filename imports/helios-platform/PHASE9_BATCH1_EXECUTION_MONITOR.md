## 🔍 HOW TO MONITOR STREAMS

### Check Stream Status (Real-Time)
```bash
# Check specific stream
copilot /read_agent stream1-cloud-sync

# Check all streams
copilot /tasks
```

### Expected Notifications
- 🟢 Each stream will notify on completion
- 🔔 Critical issues will be surfaced immediately
- 📊 Metrics will be reported per stream

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **LOC Delivered:** Target 15,000-17,500 total
- **Tests Passing:** Target 280+ all passing
- **Commits:** Target 28-35 total to main
- **Bugs:** Target 0 critical bugs

---

## 🚨 POTENTIAL BLOCKERS & MITIGATION

### Stream 3 (AI/ML) Taking Longer Than Expected
**Risk:** Critical path delay  
**Mitigation:** 
- Stream 3 is allocated 120-150 min (generous buffer)
- Batch 1 won't complete until Stream 3 done
- If delayed, only postpones Batch 2 start

### Tests Failing in a Stream
**Risk:** Stream cannot merge  
**Mitigation:**
- Stream teams fix failing tests immediately
- No stream advances without 100% test pass
- Gate prevents merge until fixed

### Conflicting Changes Between Streams
**Risk:** Merge conflicts  
**Mitigation:**
- Streams work on isolated features (no overlap)
- Each stream has own feature branch
- Merge to main only after all tests pass
- If conflicts occur: quick resolution by stream teams

### Documentation Incomplete
**Risk:** v3.6.0 release hampered  
**Mitigation:**
- Stream 9 (Docs) is non-blocking for code delivery
- Can polish docs during Batch 2/3
- Core docs will be complete

## ✨ BATCH 1 GATE REQUIREMENTS (T+140-150 min)

### Code Quality Gate
- ✅ All 7 streams complete
- ✅ All feature branches have commits
- ✅ Zero merge conflicts
- ✅ All code follows style guidelines

### Testing Gate
- ✅ 280+ tests passing
- ✅ 100% pass rate (zero failures)
- ✅ Coverage >90%
- ✅ No flaky tests

### Bug Gate

### Decision
If all gates pass: **LAUNCH BATCH 2** immediately  
If gates fail: **ROOT CAUSE & REMEDIATE** before advancing
