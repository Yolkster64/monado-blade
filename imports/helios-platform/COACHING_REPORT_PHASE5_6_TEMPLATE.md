## File-by-File Analysis

### Example 1: OrderService.cs
**Score:** 72/100  
**Status:** ✅ Good

Strengths:
- ✅ Good LINQ patterns
- ✅ Proper async/await
- ✅ DI injection working

Improvements:
- ⚠️ Missing AsNoTracking on read queries
- ⚠️ Some XML documentation missing

Coaching:
```
Rule 1.2: Add .AsNoTracking() to read-only queries
  Current: context.Orders.Where(...).ToList()
  Better:  context.Orders.AsNoTracking().Where(...).ToList()
  
Rule 4.2: Add XML documentation to public methods
  Missing on: GetOrdersAsync, ProcessOrderAsync
```

### Example 2: UserRepository.cs
**Score:** 65/100  
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Work

Issues:
- ❌ N+1 query in GetUsersWithOrders()
- ❌ Missing async/await pattern
- ⚠️ Outdated documentation

Coaching:
```
Rule 1.4 (CRITICAL): N+1 query detected
  Current:  Loop with context.Orders query inside
  Pattern:  var users = context.Users.Include(u => u.Orders).ToList()
  Impact:   1000 users = 1001 queries → 1 query
  
Rule 2.1 (CRITICAL): Make method async
  Current:  public List<User> GetUsers()
  Better:   public async Task<List<User>> GetUsersAsync()
```
