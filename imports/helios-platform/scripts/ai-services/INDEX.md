## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS

### Hub
The master orchestrator that coordinates all services, handles requests, manages conflicts, tracks costs, and enforces rate limits.

### Service Router
Intelligently routes tasks to the best-suited service based on task type, performance metrics, and cost efficiency.

### Conflict Resolver
Detects when services give conflicting recommendations and resolves them using various strategies (confidence weighting, user preferences, etc.).

### Clients
Individual API clients for each service (ChatGPT Pro, Codex, GPT-4.5) that handle authentication, requests, and responses.

### Cost Tracker
Real-time cost calculation and budget management to prevent overspending and provide cost visibility.

### Rate Limiter
Manages request rates at multiple levels (per-minute, per-hour, per-day) to prevent hitting API limits.
