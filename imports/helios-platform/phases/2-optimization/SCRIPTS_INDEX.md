### Running Scripts

**Option 1: Run Master Script (Recommended)**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\helios-platform\phases\2-optimization\scripts
.\run-all-optimizations.ps1
# Runs ALL Phase 2 optimizations in proper order
```

**Option 2: Run Individual Optimizations**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\helios-platform\phases\2-optimization\scripts
.\optimize-services-disable.ps1
.\optimize-startup-remove.ps1
# etc. (run each individually)
```

**Option 3: Test First, Then Optimize**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\helios-platform\phases\2-optimization\scripts
.\create-baseline-snapshot.ps1          # Capture baseline
.\run-all-optimizations.ps1             # Run optimizations
[Reboot if required]
.\compare-performance.ps1               # See improvements!
```

**Ready to optimize?** Run: `.\run-all-optimizations.ps1`

Or first capture baseline: `.\create-baseline-snapshot.ps1`
