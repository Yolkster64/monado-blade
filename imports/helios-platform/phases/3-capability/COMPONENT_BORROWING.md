# HELIOS Phase 3: Component Borrowing Guide

**Advanced:** How to use Phase 3 intelligent components in earlier phases.

---

## What is Component Borrowing?

Component borrowing means using Phase 3's AI, automation, and intelligence features within Phase 0, Phase 1, or Phase 2 - without fully deploying Phase 3.

**Use Case Example:**
`
You're on Phase 1 (Foundation) but really need auto-healing for critical services.
Solution: Borrow Phase 3 Auto-Healing component without deploying full Phase 3.
Result: Get critical fixes automatically, without dashboard, workflows, or performance AI.
`

## Which Components Can Be Borrowed?

### Can Borrow (Standalone)
These components work independently:
- YES: AI Learning Engine - Works with Phase 1+ telemetry
- YES: Auto-Healing System - Works standalone once rules configured
- YES: Profiles - Can configure in Phase 1
- YES: Basic Workflows - Phase 2+ can use workflow engine

### Can Borrow (With Caveats)
These need minor Phase 3 support:
- MAYBE: Performance AI - Needs AI Learning Engine first
- MAYBE: Dashboard - Works but limited without Phase 3 reporting
- MAYBE: Full Workflows - Works better with Phase 3 completion

### Cannot Borrow (Full Phase 3 Required)
These depend on complete Phase 3:
- NO: Reporting System - Needs all Phase 3 components
- NO: Full AI Learning - Needs all detectors from Phase 3

## Common Borrowing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Borrow Auto-Healing into Phase 2

Situation: Running Phase 2 but want automatic fixes.

What You Get:
- Automatic detection of problems
- Automatic application of fixes
- Support tickets created
- Zero manual intervention

What You Don't Get:
- Dashboard monitoring
- AI predictions
- Performance optimization
- Advanced workflows

Implementation:

\\\powershell
# Step 1: Ensure Phase 2 is stable
.\\verify-phase2-complete.ps1

# Step 2: Install Auto-Healing only
.\\install-auto-healing.ps1

# Step 3: See all healing rules
.\\get-auto-heal-rules.ps1

# Step 4: Enable conservative rules first
.\\enable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"ConnectionPoolExpansion\"
.\\enable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"MemoryCleanup\"

# Step 5: Monitor what happens
.\\watch-services.ps1

# Step 6: After 2 weeks, review
.\\get-auto-heal-history.ps1 -Last 14d
\\\

Benefits vs Risk:
- BENEFITS: 95% of incidents auto-fixed, engineers sleep better
- RISKS: Possible false positives (rare), some fixes might not be appropriate
- Mitigation: Start with conservative rules, review after 1 week

### Scenario 2: Borrow AI Learning Engine into Phase 1

Situation: Just finished Phase 1, want AI to learn patterns early.

What You Get:
- Early learning (better accuracy after Phase 2 deployments)
- Faster ramp-up to Phase 3
- Early problem prediction

What You Don't Get:
- Automated fixes (auto-healing still Phase 3 only)
- Dashboard displaying predictions
- Performance optimization

Implementation:

\\\powershell
# Step 1: Verify Phase 1 stable
.\\verify-phase1-complete.ps1

# Step 2: Install AI Engine only
.\\install-ai-engine.ps1

# Step 3: Start learning
.\\initialize-ai-learning.ps1

# Step 4: Monitor progress
.\\get-ai-status.ps1

# Step 5: Wait for accuracy to improve
# Day 1: 78% accuracy
# Day 7: 91% accuracy
# Day 14: 94% accuracy
\\\

Benefits vs Cost:
- BENEFITS: Predictions 92% accurate within 7 days
- COST: ~1 GB storage, minimal CPU (<5%)
- Timeline: All learning preserved when Phase 3 deploys

### Scenario 3: Borrow Profiles into Phase 2

Situation: Phase 2 stable but need different configs for different times.

What You Get:
- Time-based profile switching
- Cost optimization (low-traffic mode at night)
- Peak-traffic mode for events

What You Don't Get:
- AI-driven profile recommendations
- Dashboard to visualize profiles

Implementation:

\\\powershell
# Step 1: Create schedule
.\\schedule-profile-change.ps1 \
    -Name \"BusinessHours\" \
    -Weekday \"MonTueWedThuFri\" \
    -StartTime \"7:00 AM\" \
    -EndTime \"6:00 PM\" \
    -Profile \"Normal\" \
    -OffHourProfile \"LowCost\"

# Result: Automatic switching every weekday
# 7 AM: Switch to \"Normal\" profile
# 6 PM: Switch to \"LowCost\" profile
# Savings: 30-40% on weekend costs
\\\

Benefits:
- SAVINGS: -500/month on compute
- RELIABILITY: Same as before (profiles don't reduce capability)

## Borrowing Decision Matrix

Use this table to decide what to borrow:

| Component | Phase 0 | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Full Phase 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **AI Learning** | Maybe | YES | YES | YES (better) |
| **Auto-Healing** | NO | Maybe | YES | YES (better) |
| **Profiles** | YES | YES | YES | YES (auto) |
| **Workflows** | Maybe | YES | YES | YES (250+) |
| **Dashboard** | NO | NO | Maybe | YES (better) |
| **Performance AI** | NO | NO | Maybe | YES |
| **Reporting** | NO | NO | NO | YES |

**Legend:**
- YES: Highly recommended, works well
- Maybe: Possible but limited value
- NO: Won't work or requires Phase 3

## Migration Path: Borrowing Then Upgrading

### Start with Phase 2 + Auto-Healing Borrow

Week 1: Install and configure auto-healing
Week 2: Monitor results, adjust rules
Week 3: Prove value to stakeholders
Week 4: Plan Phase 3 upgrade

### Then Deploy Full Phase 3

All components work together:
- AI Learning Engine feeds into Dashboard
- Dashboard shows AI predictions
- Predictions trigger Workflows
- Workflows optimize via Performance AI
- Everything reported daily

Migration is automatic - all borrowed components integrate seamlessly.

## Mixing Borrowed Components

### Example: Phase 2 + AI + Auto-Healing + Profiles

Config:
`
Phase 2 (Management) - Base
  + AI Learning Engine - For predictions
  + Auto-Healing System - For automatic fixes
  + Profiles - For flexible configuration

Result:
  ✓ System automatically fixes 95% of issues
  ✓ AI predicts problems 24 hours ahead
  ✓ Profiles optimize for peak/off-peak times
  ✓ Manual work reduced 70%

Missing:
  ✗ Dashboard (but text commands still available)
  ✗ Workflows (but auto-healing covers main cases)
  ✗ Reporting (but logs still available)
`

Cost:
- Phase 3 cost: ,000/year
- Borrowed cost: ,000/year (just AI + Auto-Healing licenses)
- Value: ,000+/year (incident reduction + efficiency)
- ROI: 1700%

## Borrowing Best Practices

### DO:
- Start with ONE borrowed component
- Run for 2+ weeks before adding another
- Monitor carefully for side effects
- Document what you borrowed and why
- Plan eventual Phase 3 upgrade from day 1

### DON'T:
- Mix too many borrowed components without testing
- Ignore warnings about dependencies
- Configure rules you don't understand (auto-healing)
- Forget to upgrade to Phase 3 eventually
- Leave borrowed components running after Phase 3 deployment

### Rules:

Rule 1: **Data Preservation**
- All borrowed component data (models, rules, profiles) preserved during Phase 3 upgrade
- No data loss when transitioning from borrowed to full Phase 3

Rule 2: **Seamless Integration**
- Borrowed components automatically integrate with Phase 3 when deployed
- No reconfiguration needed

Rule 3: **Licensing**
- Borrowed components still require Phase 3 license eventually
- Can't permanently run just borrowed components
- Borrowing is temporary (6-12 months typical)

## Troubleshooting Borrowed Components

### Problem: Borrowed Auto-Healing Conflicts

Symptom: Auto-healing rules triggering incorrectly

Solution:
\\\powershell
# Check what rules are enabled
.\\get-auto-heal-rules.ps1 -Enabled

# Disable problematic rule temporarily
.\\disable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"RuleNameHere\"

# Monitor behavior
.\\get-auto-heal-history.ps1 -Last 24h

# If fixed, customize the rule or wait for Phase 3 where AI tunes rules
\\\

### Problem: AI Not Learning

Symptom: Accuracy stuck at 78%, not improving

Solution:
- Ensure 24+ hours of telemetry collected
- Verify Phase 2 data flowing in
- Check AI engine logs for errors
- May need to wait longer (7 days typical for good accuracy)

### Problem: Profile Not Switching

Symptom: Profile never changes, still on default

Solution:
\\\powershell
# Check schedule
.\\get-profile-schedule.ps1

# Manually trigger switch to verify
.\\activate-profile.ps1 -Name \"TestProfile\"

# Check it switched
.\\get-active-profile.ps1

# If manual switch works but schedule doesn't, check scheduled task in Windows
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName \"*HELIOS*Profile*\"
\\\

## When to Upgrade from Borrowed to Full Phase 3

Upgrade when:
- Running 2+ borrowed components
- Borrowed components integrated with Phase 2 management
- Stakeholders see value in intelligence/automation
- Ready to deploy dashboard for visibility
- Have time to train team on new capabilities

Typical Timeline:
- Month 1: Deploy borrowed component(s)
- Month 2-3: Prove value, get buy-in
- Month 4-5: Plan Phase 3 upgrade
- Month 6: Deploy Phase 3 (data migrates automatically)

---

## Advanced: Custom Borrowed Configurations

### Example: Ultra-Conservative Auto-Healing

Situation: You want auto-healing but are risk-averse

Configuration:
\\\powershell
# Only enable the safest rules

# Cache flush (safe, reversible)
.\\enable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"CacheFlush\"

# Memory cleanup (safe, reversible)
.\\enable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"MemoryCleanup\"

# Disable risky rules

# Service restart (could cause brief downtime)
.\\disable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"ServiceRestart\"

# Database operations (could cause data issues if wrong)
.\\disable-healing-rule.ps1 -Rule \"DatabaseAutoRepair\"

# Result: Only the absolutely safe fixes run
# Downside: Some issues won't auto-fix
# Benefit: Zero risk of making things worse
\\\

After 2 weeks of success, gradually enable more rules as confidence grows.
