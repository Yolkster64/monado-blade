## Execution Order

**Must follow this sequence**:

```
1. usb-creator.ps1
   ↓ (Wait for completion, creates USB)
   
2. windows-installer.ps1
   ↓ (Boot from USB, install Windows)
   
3. partition-manager.ps1
   ↓ (Run on installed Windows)
   
4. storage-setup.ps1
   ↓ (Creates folder structure)
   
5. system-baseline.ps1
   ↓ (Final configuration)
   
Ready for Phase 1
```

**Can Skip?**
- USB Creator: Only if already have bootable media
- Windows Installer: Only if Windows already fresh-installed
- Partition Manager: Only if already have C: and D: drives
- Storage Setup: Only if folders already created
- System Baseline: Recommended to always run (safe to re-run)

**Run Together?**
- No. Each depends on previous step's output.
- Must complete one fully before starting next.
- Exception: Can re-run same script multiple times.

## Error Handling

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Access Denied" | Not admin | Right-click PowerShell → Run as Administrator |
| "File not found" | Script path wrong | Use `cd` to navigate to correct folder |
| "USB not found" | Drive disconnected | Plug USB in, wait 5 seconds, retry |
| "Insufficient space" | Drive too small | Need larger drive or resize |
| "Registry error" | Permissions issue | Run as Administrator, disable antivirus |
| "Timeout" | Script taking too long | Wait longer, check for user prompts |

### Log Locations for Troubleshooting

```
C:\HELIOS\logs\phase0\
├── usb-creator-[DATE].log
├── partition-manager-[DATE].log
├── storage-setup-[DATE].log
└── system-baseline-[DATE].log
```

## Performance Notes

**Fastest Sequence on SSD**:
- usb-creator: ~10 min
- windows-installer: ~20 min
- partition-manager: ~5 min
- storage-setup: ~2 min
- system-baseline: ~8 min
- **Total**: ~45 minutes

**Slowest Sequence on HDD**:
- usb-creator: ~20 min (slow drive speed)
- windows-installer: ~35 min (HDD write speed)
- partition-manager: ~10 min (disk operations)
- storage-setup: ~5 min
- system-baseline: ~15 min
- **Total**: ~85 minutes

**Ways To Speed Up**:
- Use USB 3.0 port (not 2.0)
- Use high-speed USB drive (not cheap drive)
- Install on SSD (much faster than HDD)
- Close other programs (frees up RAM/CPU)
- Disable antivirus temporarily (careful!)
