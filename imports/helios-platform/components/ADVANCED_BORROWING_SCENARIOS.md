# Advanced Borrowing Scenarios

Complex real-world examples of how to combine components from different phases to build custom HELIOS configurations.

---

## Overview

These scenarios show how to mix and match components to create exactly what you need, using borrowing to avoid installing entire phases.

**Key Concept:** Borrow specific components instead of installing whole phases.

---

## Scenario 1: Dashboard + Security + Encryption (No Analytics)

**Business Need:** "We need system monitoring with user authentication and data encryption, but we don't need analytics or optimization."

**Traditional Approach:**
- Install Phase 0 (security-engine)
- Install Phase 1 (vault-dynamics AND unwanted analytics-core)
- Install Phase 3 (ai-dashboard)
- Result: 800+ MB, includes unwanted analytics

**Better Approach Using Borrowing:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Install Phase 0 - Foundation
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\helios-platform\components
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1

# Step 2: Install just Vault from Phase 1 (skip analytics)
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1

# Step 3: Borrow Dashboard from Phase 3 (don't install whole Phase 3)
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 0

# Result: 
# ✅ Dashboard with multi-user auth
# ✅ Encryption for data
# ✅ ~500 MB total
# ✅ 10-15 minutes total
# ❌ No analytics (intentional)
# ❌ No AI optimization (intentional)
```

**Component List:**
```
Installed: security-engine (P0), vault-dynamics (P1)
Borrowed: ai-dashboard (from P3)
Not Installed: analytics-core, performance-ai, cloud-bridge
```

**File Locations:**
```
C:\Program Files\HELIOS\
├── security-engine\ (Phase 0)
├── vault-dynamics\ (Phase 1)
└── ai-dashboard\ (borrowed from Phase 3)
```

---

## Scenario 2: Full Platform Minus Cloud

**Business Need:** "Give us everything except cloud integration - we're on-premises only."

**Traditional Approach:**
- Install Phase 0
- Install Phase 1
- Install Phase 2
- Install Phase 3 minus cloud-bridge
- Problem: Can't selectively remove from phase 3

**Better Approach Using Borrowing:**

```powershell
# Phase 0: Complete foundation
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1

# Phase 1: Complete
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1
.\components\analytics-core\install.ps1

# Phase 2: Complete
.\components\performance-ai\install.ps1

# Phase 3: Borrow only dashboard (not cloud-bridge)
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 0

# Result:
# ✅ All Phase 0, 1, 2 features
# ✅ Dashboard from Phase 3
# ❌ Cloud-bridge stays uninstalled (by design)
```

**What You Get:**
```
✅ Security with authentication
✅ Encryption and key management
✅ Data analytics and reporting
✅ AI performance optimization
✅ System monitoring dashboard
❌ No cloud integration
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Smaller footprint (~1.3 GB instead of 1.5 GB)
- Simpler configuration (no cloud credentials needed)
- Faster installation (no cloud SDK download)
- On-premises only deployment

---

## Scenario 3: Monitoring + Optimization Only

**Business Need:** "We just want AI optimization recommendations and a dashboard. Nothing else."

**Challenge:** performance-ai requires security-engine, but we want minimal overhead

**Solution Using Borrowing:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Install minimal security
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -MinimalConfiguration

# This installs security-engine with:
# - Local authentication only (no cloud)
# - SQLite instead of SQL Server
# - Minimal audit logging
# - ~156 MB

# Step 2: Install performance-ai (now has required security-engine)
.\components\performance-ai\install.ps1

# Step 3: Borrow dashboard
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 0

# Result:
# ✅ AI performance optimization
# ✅ System monitoring dashboard
# ✅ Lightweight security foundation
# ✅ ~600 MB total
# ❌ No encryption
# ❌ No analytics database
# ❌ No cloud
```

**Perfect For:**
- Development/testing environments
- Small team deployments
- Bandwidth-limited environments
- Containers and edge computing

---

## Scenario 4: Encryption-First Infrastructure

**Business Need:** "Encryption is critical in our industry. We need encryption available everywhere, plus a dashboard to see what's encrypted."

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Security foundation (for audit)
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1

# Step 2: Encryption (primary feature)
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1

# Step 3: Analytics for monitoring what's encrypted
.\components\analytics-core\install.ps1

# Step 4: Borrow dashboard to visualize encryption metrics
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 1

# All components now integrate with encryption as primary feature
```

**Dashboard Shows:**
- Encryption operations (encrypt/decrypt count)
- Key rotation status
- Failed decryption attempts (security alerts)
- Encrypted storage usage

**Configuration Example:**

```json
// vault-dynamics config
{
  "encryption": {
    "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
    "keyRotation": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalDays": 30
    }
  },
  "audit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "trackAllOperations": true
  }
}

// ai-dashboard config
{
  "dashboards": {
    "primaryDashboard": "Encryption-Focused",
    "widgets": [
      "encryption-status",
      "key-rotation-schedule",
      "failed-decryption-alerts",
      "storage-encrypted-percentage"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Scenario 5: Legacy App Integration

**Business Need:** "We have a legacy application that needs secure data storage and a new monitoring interface. We can't modify the legacy app."

**Constraints:**
- Legacy app can't use new security system
- Only needs encryption and monitoring
- Can't change legacy app authentication

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Step 1: Install encryption independently
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1

# Configure vault to work independently
# Legacy app calls vault's API directly for encrypt/decrypt

# Step 2: Install lightweight security for dashboard users only
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -Mode "DashboardOnly"

# This security-engine only manages dashboard access
# Does NOT integrate with legacy app

# Step 3: Borrow dashboard
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 1

# Result:
# ✅ Legacy app uses vault encryption directly
# ✅ Modern dashboard for operations teams
# ✅ Legacy app unmodified
# ✅ Both systems coexist
```

**Architecture:**
```
Legacy Application
     ↓
     ├→ Vault Encryption API (for data encryption)
     └→ Not affected by other HELIOS components

Operations Team
     ↓
     ├→ AI Dashboard (authentication via security-engine)
     ├→ View encryption metrics
     ├→ View system status
     └→ Manage dashboard access (separate from app)
```

## Scenario 6: Development Team Setup

**Business Need:** Each developer needs their own lightweight HELIOS instance for testing, not full platform.

**Per-Developer Setup:**

```powershell
# Install on each developer's machine:

# Step 1: Lightweight security (local users only)
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -LocalOnly

# Step 2: Dashboard for development testing
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 0

# Optional: Add encryption for sensitive test data
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1 -DevelopmentMode

# Result per developer:
# ✅ Local authentication
# ✅ Dashboard for testing UI
# ✅ Optional encryption for test data
# ✅ Lightweight (no performance AI, no analytics)
# ✅ No cloud, no complex setup
# ✅ ~300 MB per machine
```

**Shared Production Setup:**

```powershell
# Separate production instance with full features:

# Phase 0: Production security
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -Production

# Phase 1: Production vault + analytics
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1 -Production
.\components\analytics-core\install.ps1

# Phase 2: Production optimization
.\components\performance-ai\install.ps1 -Production

# Phase 3: Production dashboard
.\borrow-component.ps1 -ComponentName "ai-dashboard" -FromPhase 3 -ToPhase 0

# Result: Full featured, optimized production
```

**Cost/Resource Benefit:**
- Dev machines: Minimal resources
- Production machine: Full features
