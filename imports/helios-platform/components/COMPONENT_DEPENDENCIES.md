## Dependency Overview

### Mandatory vs Optional Dependencies

**Mandatory (Hard):** Component cannot function without this
**Optional (Soft):** Component works alone, but features enhance with this
**System:** Built into Windows, no installation needed

Audit Logging               - Works always (to Event Log)
Access Control              - Works always
```

### PERFORMANCE-AI (Phase 2)

**Type:** AI Optimization - DEPENDS ON security-engine

| Dependency | Type | Version | Required | Auto-Install |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **security-engine** | **Component** | **1.2.0+** | **YES** | **Auto (if missing)** |
| .NET Framework | Runtime | 4.8+ | YES | No - May need manual |
| TensorFlow | ML Framework | 2.10+ | YES | Auto (bundled) |
| NumPy/SciPy | Python libs | Latest | YES | Auto (bundled) |
| GPU Support (NVIDIA/AMD) | Hardware | Optional | NO | Works on CPU |

**Hard dependency on security-engine because:**
- User authentication and authorization
- Audit logging of all optimization changes
- Session management for multiple users
- Secure encrypted configuration storage

**Can work without security-engine?** NO - Installation fails

**Error if not present:**
```
Error: security-engine (v1.2.0+) is a mandatory dependency for performance-ai
Solution: Install security-engine first
```

**Installation order:**
```
1. Install security-engine (Phase 0) first
   |
2. Install performance-ai (Phase 2)
   |
3. TensorFlow and models auto-install
   |
4. AI optimizer is ready
```

---

### AI-DASHBOARD (Phase 3)

**Type:** GUI Dashboard - NO dependencies on other HELIOS components!

| Dependency | Type | Version | Required | Fallback |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|----------|
| .NET Framework | Runtime | 4.8+ | YES | No |
| Windows Event Log | System | Any | YES | No |

**Can it be installed standalone?** YES - Completely independent

**Works without .NET 4.8?** NO - Will not run
**Works without Windows Event Log?** NO - Cannot display events

**Limitations when standalone (without security-engine):**
```
Feature                | With security-engine | Standalone |
User authentication    | Multi-user, RBAC    | Single user |
Access control        | Enforced             | None        |
Audit logging         | Complete             | Basic       |
MFA support           | Yes                  | No          |
Role-based features   | Yes                  | No          |
```

### CLOUD-BRIDGE (Phase 3)

**Type:** Cloud Integration - DEPENDS ON security-engine AND vault-dynamics

| Dependency | Type | Version | Required | Auto-Install |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **security-engine** | **Component** | **1.2.0+** | **YES** | Warn (may fail) |
| **vault-dynamics** | **Component** | **1.5.0+** | **YES** | Warn (may fail) |
| Azure SDK / AWS SDK | Software | Latest | YES | Auto (bundled) |
| Internet Connection | Network | Any | YES | Required |

**Why needs security-engine:**
- Identity federation with Azure AD / AWS IAM
- Access control to cloud resources
- Audit logging of cloud operations

**Why needs vault-dynamics:**
- Encrypting credentials before cloud upload
- Secure key exchange with cloud
- Encrypted backup storage

**Can work without both?** NO - Installation fails

**Installation order:**
```
1. Install security-engine (Phase 0)
   |
2. Install vault-dynamics (Phase 1)
   |
3. Install cloud-bridge (Phase 3)
   |
4. Cloud SDKs auto-install

## Dependency Troubleshooting

### Component Won't Install - Missing Dependency
```powershell
# Find what's missing
Get-MissingDependencies -ComponentName "performance-ai"

# Install the missing component
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1

# Then try again
.\components\performance-ai\install.ps1
```

### Component Crashes on Startup
```powershell
# Verify all dependencies are correct version
Test-ComponentDependencies -ComponentName "performance-ai" -Verbose

# May need to upgrade
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -Upgrade
```

### Dependency Version Conflict
```powershell
# Show installed vs required
Get-DependencyMismatch -ComponentName "cloud-bridge"

# Auto-fix with upgrades
.\install.ps1 -ComponentName "cloud-bridge" -UpgradeDependencies
```
