## Migration Paths

### Upgrading Versions

**Safe upgrade path:**
```
Current: Phase 0 (1.0.0)
To:      Phase 0 (1.2.0)
Method:  In-place upgrade
Result:  ✅ Safe, all dependencies updated
```

**Adding new component:**
```
Current: Phase 0 + 1
Adding:  Phase 2 (performance-ai)
Method:  New install
Check:   Automatically verifies phase 0 compatibility
Result:  ✅ Works (needs security-engine v1.2.0+)
```

**Borrowing component:**
```
Current: Phase 2
Borrow:  ai-dashboard from Phase 3
Method:  Special borrow script
Check:   Verifies no version conflicts
Result:  ✅ Dashboard added with Phase 2 components
```

---

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Performance-AI Says "security-engine Not Found"
**Why:** You have security-engine v1.0.5, but performance-ai needs v1.2.0+
**Solution:** Upgrade security-engine
```powershell
.\components\security-engine\install.ps1 -Upgrade
```

### Issue: Dashboard Won't Display Analytics Data
**Why:** analytics-core not installed
**Solution:** Install analytics-core OR use dashboard without it
```powershell
# Option A: Install analytics
.\components\analytics-core\install.ps1

# Option B: Continue without analytics
# Dashboard shows system metrics, just not custom analytics
```

### Issue: Cloud-Bridge Installation Fails
**Why:** Missing vault-dynamics
**Solution:** Install vault first
```powershell
.\components\vault-dynamics\install.ps1
.\components\cloud-bridge\install.ps1
```

### Issue: Components Compete for Resources
**Why:** Both ai-dashboard and performance-ai want system resources
**Solution:** Configure resource limits
```json
// In ai-dashboard config.json
"resources": {
  "maxCpuPercent": 20,
  "maxMemoryMB": 500
}

// In performance-ai config.json
"resources": {
  "maxCpuPercent": 30,
  "maxMemoryMB": 1024
}
```

## Compatibility Checklist

Before installing a new component:

```
[ ] Check required dependencies (see component README)
[ ] Verify .NET Framework version (min 4.6.1)
[ ] Check disk space (see COMPONENT_CATALOG.md)
[ ] Verify port availability (dashboard needs 8080, etc.)
[ ] Review known conflicts (see above)
[ ] Back up current configuration
[ ] Test new component immediately after install
[ ] Verify no performance degradation
```

---

## Summary

**Key Rules:**
1. ✅ All Phase 0, 1, 3 components work independently
2. ❌ Phase 2 (performance-ai) requires Phase 0 (security-engine)
3. ❌ Phase 3 (cloud-bridge) requires Phases 0 + 1
4. ✅ ai-dashboard needs NO other HELIOS components
5. ✅ You can borrow any component to any phase without conflicts
