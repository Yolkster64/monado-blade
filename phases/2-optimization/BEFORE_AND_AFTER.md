| **File Transfer (LAN)** | 50 Mbps | 65 Mbps | +30% |
| **Ping/Latency** | 45 ms | 42 ms | 6% lower |

**Real-world example (downloading a 1 GB file):**
```
Connection: 8 Mbps (typical residential)

BEFORE (poorly optimized):
- Packet loss: 0.5% (needs retransmission)
- Retransmissions: Entire frames
- Time: 1,024 MB ÷ 8 Mbps = 128 seconds
- With retransmissions: ~150 seconds (2.5 minutes)

AFTER (well optimized):
- Packet loss: 0.5% (same network)
- Retransmissions: Only lost packets (SACK enabled)
- Time: 1,024 MB ÷ 8 Mbps = 128 seconds
- With efficient retransmissions: ~135 seconds (2.25 minutes)
- Plus: Larger TCP window = smoother throughput

Net Gain: ~15 seconds faster (10% improvement)
Plus: Feels much smoother, fewer stalls
```

#### 7. Storage Optimization Impact

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Disk Space Freed | 5-20 GB |

| Defragmentation Percentage | 25-35% fragmentation → 0-5% |
| Windows Update Cache Cleaned | 500 MB - 5 GB |
| Temporary Files Cleaned | 1-3 GB |

**Hard Drive Fragmentation Impact:**
```
BEFORE (Highly Fragmented):
- File pieces scattered across disk platter
- Disk head: Seek → Read piece 1 → Seek → Read piece 2 → Seek → Read piece 3
- Multiple seeks = slow read speed
- 1 GB file read time: 45 seconds (fragmented across 500+ pieces)

AFTER (Defragmented):
- File in contiguous sectors
- Disk head: Read piece 1 → piece 2 → piece 3 (no seeks)
- Sequential read = fast read speed
- 1 GB file read time: 15 seconds (sequential read)

Net Gain: 30 seconds faster (66% improvement) per GB read
```

**Example: Program Launch**
```
Launching a 500 MB application

BEFORE (Fragmented disk):
- Program requests 500 MB
- Disk head seeks randomly 100+ times
- Each seek = 10 ms delay
- Total seek time: 1 second
- Actual read time: 2 seconds
- Program loading... 3+ seconds

AFTER (Defragmented):
- Program requests 500 MB
- Disk reads sequentially (0 seeks)
- Seek time: 0 seconds
- Actual read time: 2 seconds
- Program loading... 2 seconds ✓

Net Gain: 1 second faster (33% faster program launch)
```
