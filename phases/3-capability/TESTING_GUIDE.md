# Expected: Status = Running

# Try to access in browser
# URL: http://localhost:9000
# Expected: Dashboard loads, shows green "System Healthy" indicator
```

**Test 1.2: Real-Time Metric Updates**
```powershell
# Check dashboard is updating metrics every 2 seconds
# Look at dashboard metrics charts
# Observe: CPU, RAM, Disk charts should show continuous updates
# Expected: Charts update smoothly, no freezing

# Wait 30 seconds
# Expected: Clear progression of data points on charts
```

**Test 1.3: WebSocket Connection**
```powershell
# Check WebSocket is connected
# Dashboard browser console (F12 → Console):
console.log(window.websocket.readyState);

# Expected: 1 (OPEN)
```

**Test 1.4: Theme Switching**
```powershell
# On dashboard, switch theme (light ↔ dark)
# Expected: Theme changes immediately
# Expected: Preference saved (persists after refresh)
```

**Test 1.5: Data Accuracy**
```powershell
# Compare dashboard metrics with system metrics
.\get-dashboard-status.ps1

# Check that CPU % shown = actual system CPU %
# Check that RAM shown = actual RAM usage
# Allow ±3% variance (network latency)
```

### Automated Tests
```powershell
Script: test-dashboard.ps1
Tests: 5 total
├─ Service running
├─ Port 9000 responding

```

### Troubleshooting Dashboard

| Problem | Check | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Won't start | `Get-Service HELIOS-Dashboard` | Restart service or check logs |
| Shows "No Data" | Check telemetry collection | Verify Phase 2 metrics flowing |
| Slow loading | Check browser cache | `.\reset-dashboard-cache.ps1` |
