# GitHub Project Setup Guide

## Creating the GitHub Project (Manual Steps via Web)

### Step 1: Create Project Board

1. Go to: https://github.com/M0nado/helios-platform
2. Click **"Projects"** tab

title: "[FEATURE] "
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''
---

## Feature Description
[Describe the feature]

## Why This Feature
[Explain the benefit]

## Affected Phase/Component
- Phase: 
- Component:

```

## Automating Project Management

### GitHub Actions Workflow to Auto-Add Issues to Project

Create `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`:

```yaml
name: Auto-add to Project

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/M0nado/helios-platform/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          labeled: ready
```

## Using the GitHub Project

### For Users/Contributors

1. **View Project**: https://github.com/M0nado/helios-platform/projects/1
2. **Pick a Task**: Find unassigned task in Backlog
3. **Self-Assign**: Click "Assignees" and select yourself
4. **Move to In Progress**: Drag issue to "In Progress" column
5. **Create Branch**: Use GitHub Desktop or CLI
6. **Submit PR**: When ready for review

### For Team Leads

1. **Monitor Progress**: View project board regularly
2. **Unblock Issues**: Check "In Progress" for blocked items
3. **Move to Review**: When PR created, move to "Review"
4. **Merge**: Move to "Done" when PR merged
5. **Track Metrics**: Count cards in each column for velocity

## GitHub Codespaces Launch

### Pre-configured Commands

In Codespaces terminal:

```bash
# List all phases
ls phases/

# View current phase docs
cat phases/0-foundation/README.md

# Run a script
pwsh ./phases/0-foundation/build.ps1

# Push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Work on feature X"
git push origin feature-branch
```

### Codespaces Settings

1. Go to https://github.com/M0nado/helios-platform/settings/codespaces
2. Set **Default Machine Type**: Standard (4-core, 8GB RAM)
3. Enable **Prebuild configurations** for faster startup
4. Set **Idle timeout**: 30 minutes

## View Project Status

3. **Assign to Milestones** - Group by phase (15 min)
4. **Setup Automation** - Deploy GitHub Actions (10 min)
5. **Enable Codespaces** - Configure prebuild (5 min)
6. **Test Everything** - Create first branch and PR (20 min)

**Total Setup Time: ~85 minutes**

## PowerShell Script to Create Issues via API

```powershell
# Note: Requires GitHub CLI or REST API token

$token = $env:GITHUB_TOKEN
$owner = "M0nado"
$repo = "helios-platform"

$issues = @(
    @{ title = "USB Creator Script"; phase = 0; component = "Installer"; priority = "Critical" },
    @{ title = "AppLocker Baseline"; phase = 1; component = "Security"; priority = "High" },
    # ... more issues
)

foreach ($issue in $issues) {
    $body = @{
        title = $issue.title
        body = "Phase: $($issue.phase)`nComponent: $($issue.component)`nPriority: $($issue.priority)"
        labels = @("phase-$($issue.phase)", $issue.component)
    } | ConvertTo-Json

    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/issues" `
        -Method POST `
        -Headers @{ Authorization = "token $token"; Accept = "application/vnd.github.v3+json" } `
        -Body $body
}
```

Save as `scripts/utilities/create-github-issues.ps1` and run once to populate project.
