## 🏗️ Execution Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation (2 hours - Sequential)
- Database schema + EF Core DbContext
- AI Hub orchestration framework
- Publish core interfaces
- **Gate:** Both tasks 100% complete

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (5 hours - 9 Parallel Streams)
- **Track A:** AI Learning system (4 tasks)
- **Track B:** Infrastructure management (5 tasks)
- **Expected:** 16h + 20h work → 5h wall-clock
- **Improvement:** +40% AI cache, +70% infrastructure throughput

### Phase 2: Features (8 hours - 8 Parallel Streams, Overlaps Phase 1)
- **Track C:** Coda Integration (3 tasks)
- **Track D:** GPU/Gaming (2 tasks)
- **Track E:** Security (1 task)
- **Tracks F-I:** Docs, Installer, Tests, Performance (4 tasks)
- **Expected:** 40h work → 8h wall-clock
- **Improvement:** +50% Coda performance, +60% GPU startup

### Phase 3: Integration (6 hours - Sequential)
- Feature merge (2h)
- Regression testing (2h)
- Release procedures (2h)
- **Output:** v2.5.0-beta ready for production

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 0 delays | LOW | CRITICAL | Allocate best engineers, start immediately |
| Integration conflicts | MEDIUM | HIGH | Real-time conflict detection + resolution |
| Performance regression | LOW | HIGH | Parallel profiling + validation gates |
| Test failures | MEDIUM | HIGH | 95%+ coverage requirement + regression suite |

### Rollback Strategy
- Phase 0 failure: Revert schema (25 min)
- Phase 1 failure: Revert single stream, retry
- Phase 2 failure: Revert feature, keep others (30 min - 2h)
- Phase 3 failure: Tag as rc instead of beta (1h delay)
