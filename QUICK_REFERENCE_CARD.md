## 🚨 Top 5 Critical Coaching Rules

### Rule 1: No .Result or .Wait() (CRITICAL)
```csharp
❌ var result = asyncMethod().Result;  // DEADLOCK RISK!
✅ var result = await asyncMethod();   // Correct
```
**Impact:** Prevents deadlocks  
**Ref:** COACHING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Rule 2.1

---

### Rule 2: Fix N+1 Queries (CRITICAL)
```csharp
❌ foreach (var user in users)  // Loop with query inside
   var orders = context.Orders.Where(o => o.UserId == user.Id).ToList();

✅ var users = context.Users.Include(u => u.Orders).ToList();
```
**Impact:** 1000x faster  
**Ref:** COACHING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Rule 1.4

---

### Rule 3: Multiple Materializations (HIGH)
```csharp
❌ var data = context.Orders.Where(...).ToList().Where(...).ToList();
✅ var data = context.Orders.Where(...).Where(...).ToList();
```
**Impact:** 70% less memory  
**Ref:** COACHING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Rule 1.1

---

### Rule 4: Add AsNoTracking (HIGH)
```csharp
❌ var reports = context.Reports.Where(...).ToList();
✅ var reports = context.Reports.AsNoTracking().Where(...).ToList();
```
**Impact:** 30-50% faster reads  
**Ref:** COACHING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Rule 1.2

---

### Rule 5: Use DI Container (HIGH)
```csharp
❌ var service = new OrderService();
✅ private readonly IOrderService service;  // Injected
```
**Impact:** 100% improvement in testability  
**Ref:** COACHING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md - Rule 3.2

## 📊 Scoring Quick Reference

### Scoring Formula
```
Overall = (LINQ × 0.30) + (Modern × 0.30) + (Docs × 0.25) + (Deps × 0.15)
```

### Score Interpretation
- 0-30: Critical - complete rewrite
- 31-50: Poor - major refactoring
- 51-70: Acceptable - improvements needed
- 71-85: Good - minor optimizations
- 86-95: Excellent - production ready
- 96-100: Exceptional - example code

### Target Scores
- LINQ: 75/100
- Modernization: 78/100
- Documentation: 80/100
- Dependencies: 78/100
- **Overall: 77/100** ← MAIN TARGET

## 🔧 Coaching Workflow

### For Each Code Block:
```
1. Check Rule 2.1 (.Result/.Wait) → CRITICAL
2. Check Rule 1.4 (N+1 queries) → CRITICAL
3. Check Rule 1.1 (Multiple ToList) → HIGH
4. Check Rule 1.2 (Missing AsNoTracking) → HIGH
5. Check Rule 3.2 (No DI) → HIGH
6. Check Rules 1.3, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.3 → MEDIUM
7. Check Rules 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 → LOW
8. Calculate score
9. Provide feedback with guide references
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with CRITICAL:** Fix .Result/.Wait() and N+1 queries first
2. **Then HIGH:** AsNoTracking, multiple ToList(), no DI
3. **Then MEDIUM:** CancellationToken, ConfigureAwait, duplicates
4. **Then LOW:** Documentation, magic values

**Result:** 77/100+ in 2-4 weeks
