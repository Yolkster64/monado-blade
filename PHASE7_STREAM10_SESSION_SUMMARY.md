## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### CacheService Architecture
```csharp
CacheService (main implementation)
├── L2CacheEntry<T> (internal)
├── QueryCacheEntry<T> (internal)
├── ObjectPool<T> (internal)
└── Manages:
    ├── L2 Cache state (with TTL, pattern invalidation)
    ├── Query Cache state (with LRU, entry limit)
    └── Object Pool state (by type)

Public Interface:
├── L2 operations: GetOrCreateAsync, GetAsync, SetAsync, RemoveAsync, InvalidatePatternAsync
├── Query operations: GetOrExecuteQueryAsync, GetOrExecuteQuery, InvalidateQuery, InvalidateQueryPattern
├── Pool operations: RentObject, ReturnObject, GetArrayPool
└── Statistics: GetCacheStatistics, GetQueryCacheStatistics, GetPoolStatistics
```

### SystemMonitoringService Architecture
```csharp
SystemMonitoringService (main implementation)
├── Manages:
│   ├── Server monitoring (health, performance)
│   ├── Service health (individual checks)
│   ├── System management (partitions, services)
│   └── Alert management (tracking, events)
├── Events:
│   ├── HealthCheckFailed
│   ├── ServiceRestarted
│   └── HealthAlert
└── Monitoring Loop (optional background task)

Public Interface:
├── Server monitoring: GetServerHealthAsync, GeneratePerformanceReportAsync
├── Service health: GetServiceHealthAsync, CheckServiceHealthAsync
├── System management: GetPartitionsAsync, GetServicesAsync, StartServiceAsync, StopServiceAsync, RestartServiceAsync
├── Alert management: GetCurrentAlertsAsync, ClearAlertAsync, AddAlert
└── Monitoring control: StartHealthMonitoring, StopHealthMonitoring
```

---

## BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY STRATEGY

### Adapter Pattern Ready
For services still using old interfaces:
```csharp
public class L2CacheAdapter : IL2CacheService
{
    private readonly ICacheService _cacheService;
    // Adapts all old method calls to new service
}

public class ServerMonitoringAdapter : IServerMonitoringService
{
    private readonly ISystemMonitoringService _monitoringService;
    // Adapts old monitoring interface to new service
}
```

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1** (Complete): Create unified services ✅
2. **Phase 2** (Pending): Update callers to use new interfaces
3. **Phase 3** (Pending): Create adapters for remaining legacy code
4. **Phase 4** (Pending): Remove deprecated interfaces

---

## REMAINING CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Server Management Consolidation (Pending)
- **Services**: ServerServiceManager + ServiceOrchestrator + DeploymentService
- **Expected Reduction**: 3 → 1 service
- **Complexity**: High (complex deployment logic, dependency resolution)
- **Estimated Effort**: 45-60 minutes
- **Benefit**: Unified server/deployment operations

### Security Services Review
- **Services**: SecurityVaultService + WindowsHardeningService
- **Status**: Consider keeping separate (different concerns)
- **Expected Reduction**: 0-1 services
- **Rationale**: Vault management vs system hardening are distinct

### UI Services Consolidation
- **Services**: StudioDashboardService, AlertManagementService, PerformanceGraphService, etc.
- **Status**: UI services often specialized; consolidate with care
- **Expected Reduction**: 0-3 services
- **Approach**: Group only closely-related UI concerns
