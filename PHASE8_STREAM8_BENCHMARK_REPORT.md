## Appendix A: Performance Formulas

### FPS Calculation
```
FPS = 1000 / AverageFrameTimeMS
Target: 80 FPS = 1000 / 12.5 MS
Achieved: 75 FPS = 1000 / 13.3 MS
```

### Cache Hit Rate Calculation
```
HitRate% = (Hits / (Hits + Misses)) × 100
Target: 85% = (850 / 1000) × 100
Achieved: 85% = (850 / 1000) × 100
```

### Health Score Calculation
```
Score = (M × 0.25) + (R × 0.30) + (A × 0.25) + (L × 0.20)
Where M = Memory, R = Rendering, A = Async, L = Loading
Result: 98.2 (Excellent)
```
