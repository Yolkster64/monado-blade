- **Notification Channels**: Sends alerts to Slack, Teams, email
- **Data Warehouses**: Exports data to BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift

## Troubleshooting

### Scripts Not Running
- Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify file permissions on database directory

### Empty Database Results
- Run learning-engine scripts first to populate data
- Wait for sufficient data collection (minimum 1 hour recommended)
- Check database connection strings in scripts

### Low Model Accuracy
- Ensure feedback-loop runs regularly (every 1-24 hours)
- Check that diverse data is being collected
- May need 2-4 weeks of data for optimal accuracy

## Performance Tuning

### For Large Deployments (1000+ metrics)
- Increase batch size in pattern-extractor.ps1
- Implement database indexing for frequent queries
- Use aggregation intervals of 5+ minutes

### For Real-time Requirements
- Run feedback loop every 5-15 minutes instead of hourly
- Reduce model retraining threshold from 2% to 1%
- Cache frequently accessed predictions

### For Cost Optimization
- Focus on cost-analyzer.ps1 and optimization-suggester.ps1
- Run cost-analyzer weekly instead of daily
- Implement recommended optimizations in priority order

## Support & Maintenance

- **Daily**: Run feedback-loop.ps1 for model updates
- **Weekly**: Execute full analytics pipeline
- **Monthly**: Review optimization-history and apply recommendations
- **Quarterly**: Retrain all ML models with accumulated data
