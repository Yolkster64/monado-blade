## BRANCH COVERAGE ANALYSIS

### Decision Points Coverage

| Component | Branches | Covered | Uncovered | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| HeliosDeployment | 24 | 22 | 2 | 92% |
| Validation Logic | 8 | 8 | 0 | 100% |
| Tier Selection | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Status Tracking | 5 | 5 | 0 | 100% |
| Error Handling | 12 | 10 | 2 | 83% |
| **TOTAL** | **55** | **51** | **4** | **93%** |

### Uncovered Branches

**Branch #1:** Exception catch in DeployAsync
```csharp
catch (Exception ex)  // Defensive coding - unlikely to trigger
{
    _logger?.LogError(ex, "Deployment failed");
    // ...
}
```
**Impact:** Negligible - defensive error path
**Action:** Monitor in production

**Branch #2:** Null logger handling
```csharp
_logger?.LogInformation(...);  // Null-safe access
```
**Impact:** None - properly handled
**Action:** No action needed
