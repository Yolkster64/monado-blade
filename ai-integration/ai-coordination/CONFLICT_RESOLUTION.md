# Conflict Resolution for AI Services

Procedures for handling conflicts between ChatGPT and Codex recommendations.

## Conflict Detection

Conflicts occur when different AI services suggest contradictory approaches. The system automatically detects and categorizes them.

### Conflict Categories

**Type 1: Security vs. Performance**
- ChatGPT favors: Granular rules, comprehensive logging
- Codex favors: Consolidated rules, optimized code
- Resolution: Security wins by default

**Type 2: Audit vs. Enforcement**
- ChatGPT favors: Longer audit phases (4-8 weeks)
- Codex generates: Quick enforcement scripts
- Resolution: Risk assessment determines timeline

**Type 3: Consolidation vs. Granularity**
- ChatGPT: Suggests consolidating rules
- Codex: Generates many granular rules
- Resolution: Balance based on maintenance capacity

**Type 4: Readability vs. Performance**
- ChatGPT: Recommends verbose, readable code
- Codex: Generates compact, optimized code
- Resolution: Code review determines winner

## Evaluation Criteria

### Security Criteria
```
- No credential exposure
- No privilege escalation
- Proper access controls
- Audit logging enabled
- Compliance requirements met
```

### Performance Criteria
```
- CPU usage acceptable
- Memory footprint acceptable
- Script execution time acceptable
- Scales to production load
- Monitoring enabled
```

### Maintainability Criteria
```
- Code is readable
- Error handling comprehensive
- Logging is appropriate
- Documentation exists
- Future developers can understand
```

### Compliance Criteria
```
- Meets SOC 2 requirements
- Meets ISO 27001 requirements
- Meets regulatory requirements
- Audit trail complete
- Change management followed
```

## Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to resolve conflicts automatically:

```
Decision Matrix:
- High Risk Issue → Manual Review Required
- Security Issue → ChatGPT recommendation
- Performance Issue → Codex recommendation  
- Maintainability Issue → Code Review required
- Cost Issue → Evaluate tradeoffs
```

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Automatic Resolution

Conflicts automatically resolved by policy:

```
IF conflict_type = "Security" THEN
    APPLY ChatGPT recommendation
    LOG decision with timestamp
    CONTINUE without escalation
```

### Level 2: Consensus-Based

Apply consensus logic when both recommendations have merit:

```
IF ChatGPT_score >= 8.5 AND Codex_score >= 8.5 THEN
    COMBINE recommendations
    GENERATE hybrid approach
    VALIDATE hybrid solution
```

### Level 3: Human Review

Escalate when conflict severity is high:

```
IF conflict_severity = "HIGH" THEN
    MARK for human review
    ASSIGN to security_team
    NOTIFY via email
    WAIT for approval
    CONTINUE after approval
```

## Testing AI-Generated Code

### Security Testing

```powershell
function Test-CodeSecurity {
    param([string]$Code)
    
    # Check for credential exposure
    if ($Code -match "password|api.?key|secret") {
        return $false
    }
    
    # Check for command injection
    if ($Code -match "(cmd\.exe|powershell.*-nop|bypass)") {
        return $false
    }
    
    return $true
}
```

### Performance Testing

```powershell
function Test-CodePerformance {
    param([string]$CodeFile)
    
    $startTime = [DateTime]::Now
    & $CodeFile
    $duration = ([DateTime]::Now - $startTime).TotalSeconds
    
    if ($duration -gt 10) {
        Write-Warning "Performance concern: took ${duration}s"
    }
    
    return $duration
}
```

### Functionality Testing

```powershell
function Test-CodeFunctionality {
    param([string]$CodeFile, [string]$TestCases)
    
    # Run against known test cases
    foreach ($test in $TestCases) {
        $result = & $CodeFile $test
        if (-not $result) {
            return $false
        }
    }
    
    return $true
}
```

## Conflict Resolution Examples

### Example 1: Rule Consolidation Conflict

**Situation:**
- ChatGPT (Security): "Use 100 granular rules"
- Codex: Generates 20 consolidated rules

**Analysis:**
- Security benefit: 100 rules = more precise control
- Performance benefit: 20 rules = 5x faster evaluation
- Conflict severity: Medium (valid tradeoff)

**Resolution:**
```
Test both approaches:
1. Deploy 100 rules in audit mode
2. Deploy 20 rules in audit mode
3. Compare performance metrics
4. Compare security coverage
5. Make decision based on data
```

### Example 2: Deployment Timeline Conflict

**Situation:**
- ChatGPT (Build Advisor): "Audit for 8 weeks"
- ChatGPT (Performance): "Move to enforcement after 2 weeks"

**Analysis:**
- Risk: 8 weeks = thorough but slow
- Risk: 2 weeks = fast but risky

**Resolution:**
```
Compromise approach:
- Pilot with small group: 8 weeks (2% of users)
- If successful, rollout phase 2: 4 weeks (25% of users)
- If successful, full deployment: 2 weeks (100% of users)
```

### Example 3: Code Style Conflict

**Situation:**
- ChatGPT (Code Reviewer): "Verbose, readable code"
- Codex: "Compact, optimized code"

**Analysis:**
- Maintainability: Verbose is better
- Performance: Compact is better
- Conflict severity: Low (both valid)

**Resolution:**
```
Implement code review standard:
1. Use Codex as starting point
2. Add comments for clarity
3. Validate performance acceptable
4. Merge approved code
```
