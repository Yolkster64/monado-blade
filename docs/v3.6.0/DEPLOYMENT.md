# HELIOS Platform v3.6.0 - Deployment & Operations

**Version**: 3.6.0

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Windows Server 2022 or Windows 11 Pro verified
- [ ] 4GB+ RAM available
- [ ] 10GB+ free disk space
- [ ] .NET 8.0 SDK installed
- [ ] Network connectivity tested
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates prepared
- [ ] Administrator credentials secured
- [ ] Backup strategy documented

### Installation
- [ ] Download latest release package
- [ ] Verify package SHA-256 hash
- [ ] Run installer as administrator
- [ ] Accept license agreement
- [ ] Choose configuration tier
- [ ] Configure admin credentials
- [ ] Setup cloud providers (if needed)

### Post-Installation
- [ ] Verify dashboard accessible at https://localhost:8080
- [ ] Test cloud sync functionality
- [ ] Install required plugins
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Test backup procedures
- [ ] Document configuration

## Configuration Guide

Core settings in appsettings.json:
```json
{
  "server": {
    "dashboardPort": 8080,
    "enableHttps": true
  },
  "database": {
    "provider": "SqlServer",
    "connectionString": "..."
  },
  "cloudSync": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxConcurrentSyncs": 3
  },
  "plugins": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoLoadPlugins": true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /api/health/status
Returns: { status: "Healthy", components: { ... } }
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- CPU usage (target: <70%)
- Memory usage (target: <80%)
- Disk usage (target: >10% free)
- Request latency (p95: <500ms)
- Plugin health status
- Cloud sync success rate
- Error logs (should be minimal)

## Updating to v3.6.0

1. Backup current installation and database
2. Stop HELIOS services
3. Download v3.6.0 update package
4. Run update script
5. Start services and verify health
6. Run database migrations
7. Test all features

## Rollback Procedures

If update fails:
1. Stop HELIOS services
2. Restore application from backup
3. Restore database from backup
4. Restart services
5. Verify health checks pass

## Performance Tuning

### CPU Optimization
- Increase thread pool size for high concurrency
- Enable parallel processing for batch operations
- Monitor process-level CPU usage

### Memory Optimization
- Configure caching strategy (Distributed recommended)
- Set cache size limits (2-4GB typical)
- Monitor garbage collection patterns

### Disk I/O
- Enable compression for cloud sync
- Configure batch write sizes
- Monitor disk queue length
