# HELIOS Platform v3.6.0 - Security Guide

**Version**: 3.6.0 | **Updated**: 2026-05-15

## Overview

HELIOS Platform implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers:

1. **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3+, firewall integration
2. **Application Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
3. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Operational Security**: Audit logging, threat detection

## Authentication

### Windows Authentication (Default)
- Integrated Windows authentication for local domain users
- Service accounts with least-privilege permissions
- Multi-factor authentication ready (MFA support planned)

### API Authentication
- Token-based authentication for plugin/API access
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Refresh token rotation for long-lived sessions

## Encryption

### Data at Rest
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Windows DPAPI or Azure Key Vault
- **Coverage**: Database, cloud cache, configuration

### Data in Transit
- **Protocol**: HTTPS (TLS 1.3+)
- **Certificate**: Self-signed or CA-issued
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Enabled

### Cloud Provider Credentials
- Encrypted using AES-256
- Never logged or exposed in debug output
- Automatic rotation support

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Administrator: Full system access
- Operator: Can manage cloud sync and plugins
- Viewer: Read-only dashboard access
- Custom roles: Define granular permissions

### Plugin Permissions
```
- system.metrics (read system metrics)
- cloud.sync (trigger cloud synchronization)
- alerts.write (create alerts)
- config.read (read configuration)
- config.write (modify configuration)
- plugins.manage (manage other plugins)
```

## Audit Logging

### Logged Events
- All authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Configuration changes with before/after values
- Cloud sync operations (start, stop, conflicts)
- Plugin installation/uninstallation
- User login/logout
- Administrative actions
- Security events (failed auth, permission denied)

### Log Retention
- Default: 30 days (configurable)
- Archived to secure storage for compliance
- Access logged for audit log viewing

## Compliance

### Standards
- **GDPR**: Data protection and user privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data handling requirements
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, processing integrity
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### Policies
- Password policy enforcement
- Session timeout (default 30 minutes)
- Secure password storage (PBKDF2)
- Regular security updates
- Vulnerability scanning

## Best Practices

### Installation
- [ ] Run installer as administrator
- [ ] Change default administrator password immediately
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid certificate
- [ ] Configure firewall rules to restrict dashboard access
- [ ] Disable services not needed (e.g., cloud sync if unused)

### Deployment
- [ ] Keep .NET runtime updated
- [ ] Enable Windows security features (Firewall, Defender)
- [ ] Use Active Directory authentication when possible
- [ ] Enable audit logging for all systems
- [ ] Regular backup testing

### Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor security alerts regularly
- [ ] Review audit logs weekly
- [ ] Update HELIOS and dependencies promptly
- [ ] Test backup/recovery procedures monthly
- [ ] Review access permissions quarterly

## Vulnerability Disclosure

Found a security issue? Please responsibly disclose:

1. Email: security@helios-platform.io
2. **Do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities
3. Provide detailed description and reproduction steps
4. Allow 90 days for fixes before public disclosure
5. We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours

## Known Security Limitations

- Dashboard requires network access (firewall recommended)
- Plugin marketplace lacks code review (trust community ratings)
- Default self-signed certificates (replace with CA-signed)
- Local SQL databases not encrypted by default
- MFA not yet implemented (planned for v3.7.0)

## Security Checklist for Deployment

```
Before Production:
[ ] Install security patches for Windows, .NET, HELIOS
[ ] Configure SSL/TLS with CA-signed certificate
[ ] Set strong administrator password (min 16 chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
[ ] Restrict dashboard network access (firewall rules)
[ ] Enable Windows Defender and security features
[ ] Configure backup encryption
[ ] Review and restrict plugin permissions
[ ] Test disaster recovery procedure
[ ] Enable audit logging
[ ] Configure log aggregation (ELK stack, Splunk, etc.)
[ ] Set up intrusion detection monitoring
[ ] Document security procedures
[ ] Train administrators on security best practices
```
