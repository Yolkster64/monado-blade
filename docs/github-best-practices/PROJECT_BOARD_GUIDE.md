## Automation Triggers

### GitHub Project Automation Setup

Configure in project settings:

**Automation Rules:**

```yaml
Rule 1: Auto-add to project
Trigger: New issue created
Action: Add to Backlog column

Rule 2: Move to In Progress
Trigger: PR opened
Action: Move linked issue to In Progress

Rule 3: Move to In Review
Trigger: PR review requested
Action: Move linked issue to In Review

Rule 4: Move to Done
Trigger: PR merged
Action: Move linked issue to Done

Rule 5: Archive old cards
Trigger: Card in Done for 2 weeks
Action: Archive card
```

### Manual Automation with GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`:

```yaml
name: Project Automation
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled, assigned]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, converted_to_draft, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.5.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/projects/1
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Webhook-Based Automation

```javascript
// Trigger when issue labeled as "high-priority"
if (event.action === 'labeled' && event.label.name === 'high-priority') {
  moveCardToColumn(event.issue.id, 'Ready');
  notifySlack('High priority issue added!');
}

// Trigger when PR opened
if (event.action === 'opened') {
  linkIssueToPR(event.pull_request.id, event.issue_id);
  moveCardToColumn(event.issue_id, 'In Progress');
}

// Trigger when PR merged
if (event.action === 'closed' && event.pull_request.merged) {
  moveCardToColumn(event.issue_id, 'Done');
  closeIssue(event.issue_id);
}
```

## Status Updates

### Daily Status Updates

**During Daily Stand-up:**

```markdown
For each in-progress card:
1. What's your status? (0-100%)
2. Any blockers?
3. Will it be done today?
4. Need help?

Example:
Card: "Add user authentication"
Status: 60% complete
Blocker: Waiting for design approval
Timeline: Should finish Thursday
Need: @designer review ASAP
```

### Weekly Status Report

**Every Friday (15 minutes):**

```markdown
Completed this week:
- Card 1: User authentication (✓ Done)
- Card 2: Email notifications (✓ Done)

In progress:
- Card 3: Password reset (80%)
- Card 4: 2FA setup (50%)

Blocked:
- Card 5: OAuth integration (Waiting on vendor)

Next week:
- Continue password reset
- Start 2FA testing
- Resolve OAuth blocker
```

### Monthly Review

```markdown

## Burndown Tracking

### Sprint Metrics

Track for each sprint:

```markdown
Total Story Points: 100

Daily Tracking:
Monday:    100 → 90 (10 completed)
Tuesday:   90 → 85 (5 completed)
Wednesday: 85 → 65 (20 completed)
Thursday:  65 → 50 (15 completed)
Friday:    50 → 30 (20 completed)

Ideal Line:
└─ Should decrease steadily
└─ Should reach 0 by Friday
└─ Dips show completed work

Actual vs Ideal:
If below ideal: On track or ahead
If above ideal: Behind schedule
```

### Burndown Chart

```
100 │ ╱─── Ideal
    │╱  ╱── Actual
 75 │  ╱
    │ ╱
 50 │╱
    │
 25 │
    │
  0 └────────────────
    Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri
```

### Tracking Tool

Use GitHub Issues Insights or:

```bash
# Create burndown script
npm install @actions/github

# Calculate daily points
issues_done = count(issues where closed_at == today)
total_points = sum(all story points)
burndown = total_points - completed_points
```

## Impediment Handling

### Identifying Impediments

```markdown
An impediment is something blocking progress:

✓ Waiting for external team
✓ Dependency not met
✓ Blocker in another system
✓ Missing information
✓ Resource not available
✓ Infrastructure issue

NOT impediments:
✗ "Code is hard" (work to do)
✗ "Need to learn" (learning is part of work)
✗ "Wish we had tool" (use what's available)
```

### Impediment Process

**Identify:**
```markdown
1. Name the impediment clearly
2. Explain why it's blocking
3. Estimate impact (1-10)
4. Identify what's needed to unblock
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Impediment: Waiting for API documentation from backend team
Impact: 9/10 (blocking all frontend work)
Blocker: Backend team hasn't published API docs
Needed to unblock: API specification document
Timeline: Needed by tomorrow
Owner: @backend-lead
```

**Resolve:**
```markdown
1. Escalate if needed
2. Find workaround if possible
3. Update blocker status daily
4. Celebrate when resolved
5. Prevent in future
```

**Prevention:**
```markdown
1. Communicate dependencies early
2. Get commitments upfront
3. Build dependency buffers
4. Have backup plans
5. Document lessons learned
```

## Board Best Practices

```markdown
✓ Move cards to correct column immediately

✓ Link PRs to issues in card
✓ Archive old/closed cards
✓ Keep Ready column prioritized
✓ Limit In Progress items (max 3 per person)
✓ Communicate blockers ASAP
✓ Celebrate Done items
✓ Review board in daily standup

✗ Don't leave cards in wrong column
✗ Don't ignore blocked cards
✗ Don't overload In Progress
✗ Don't archive cards before Done
✗ Don't change priorities constantly
✗ Don't neglect board maintenance
✗ Don't hide impediments
✗ Don't let cards stale
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cards Stuck in In Review

```markdown
If PR in review for > 3 days:
1. Check if reviewer has capacity
2. Request review reminder
3. Offer to pair on review
4. Escalate if critical
5. Consider breaking down
```

### Too Many Blocked Items

```markdown
If > 2 blocked items:
1. What are the common blockers?
2. Can we remove dependencies?
3. Can we unblock faster?
4. Do we need policy change?
5. Review planning process
```

### Sprint Goals Not Met

```markdown
If sprint fails 2 times:
1. Estimate too optimistic?
2. Unexpected issues appeared?
3. Team interrupted too much?
4. Complex issues need breaking down?
5. Consider retrospective focus
```
