## Team Communication

### Communication Channels

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Slack** | Quick questions, quick updates | Immediate to 2 hours |
| **GitHub Issues** | Feature requests, bug reports | Within 24 hours |
| **GitHub Discussions** | Design decisions, RFCs | Within 48 hours |
| **Email** | Formal announcements, important docs | Within business day |
| **Meetings** | Synchronous discussions | Scheduled in advance |
| **PR Comments** | Code discussion, reviews | Within 24 hours |

### Slack Communication Guidelines

```markdown
✓ Use threads to keep conversations organized
✓ Use emoji reactions to acknowledge messages
✓ Prefix with @name to get attention
✓ Use formatted code blocks for code snippets
✓ Use threads for code review discussions
✓ Post in appropriate channel

✗ Don't spam channels with notifications
✗ Don't use @channel/@here unless urgent
✗ Don't conduct technical decisions in Slack (use GitHub)
✗ Don't use Slack for sensitive information
✗ Don't ignore unanswered questions
```

### Channel Structure

```
#general          - Announcements, team-wide
#engineering      - Technical discussions
#code-review      - Code review feedback
#deployments      - Deployment updates
#random           - Off-topic fun
#help             - Questions and help
#announcements    - Official announcements
```

### Response Time Expectations

```markdown
Priority Levels:
🔴 Critical (P0): 1 hour response
🟠 High (P1): 4 hours response
🟡 Normal (P2): 24 hours response
🟢 Low (P3): 3 days response

If you can't respond in time:
1. Acknowledge receipt in Slack
2. Provide estimated response time
3. Delegate if needed
```

## Decision-Making Process

### Decision Types

**Type A: Individual (1 person)**
- Internal implementation details
- Local code organization
- Personal workflow choices

Process:
1. Decide based on guidelines
2. No approval needed
3. Can be overridden if feedback given

**Type B: Team (3+ people)**
- Feature design
- API changes
- Architecture decisions

Process:
1. Create GitHub Discussion
2. Present options and reasoning
3. Allow 48 hours for feedback
4. Team lead decides if no consensus

**Type C: Organization (whole company)**
- Release timing
- Major strategy shifts
- Policy changes

Process:
1. Create RFC (Request for Comments)
2. Present to leadership
3. Allow one week for feedback
4. Executive decision

### Decision Framework

```markdown
Step 1: Define the decision
- What exactly are we deciding?
- What are the options?
- What's the deadline?

Step 2: Gather input
- Who needs to be involved?
- What information needed?
- Where to discuss?

Step 3: Discuss
- Present all options fairly
- Debate pros/cons
- Allow time for consideration

Step 4: Decide
- Clear decision statement
- Documented rationale
- Communication plan

Step 5: Document
- Record decision
- Link to discussion
- Post decision to relevant channel
```

### Example: API Design Decision

```markdown
# RFC: Webhook Event Format

**Proposal:** Use JSON for webhook payloads

**Options:**
1. JSON format (recommended)
   - Pros: Standard, easy to parse
   - Cons: Verbose

2. MessagePack format
   - Pros: Compact, fast
   - Cons: Less standard

3. Protocol Buffers
   - Pros: Type-safe, efficient
   - Cons: More complex

**Recommendation:** JSON format

**Discussion:** See GitHub Discussion #123

**Decision:** JSON format chosen (4 votes for, 0 against)

**Next Steps:**
- Implement webhook endpoints
- Create documentation
- Update SDK
```

## Escalation Procedure

### When to Escalate

Escalate when:
- Blocked on someone's decision
- Team deadlocked on issue
- Needs authority to decide
- Disagreement won't resolve
- Critical issue needs attention

### Escalation Path

```
Level 1: Direct Conversation
├─ Talk to person directly
├─ Find common ground
├─ Try to reach consensus
└─ If no resolution → Level 2

Level 2: Team Lead
├─ Inform team lead
├─ Provide context
├─ Let them mediate
├─ Accept their decision
└─ If urgent/critical → Level 3

Level 3: Department Head
├─ Escalate formally
├─ Document the issue
├─ Present both sides
├─ Accept final decision
└─ If legal/safety → Level 4

Level 4: Executive
├─ C-level involvement
├─ Board if needed
├─ Final authority
└─ Document for record
```

### How to Escalate

**Email Template:**

```markdown
Subject: Escalation: [Issue Name] - Decision Needed

To: [Team Lead Name]

Context:
[Brief explanation of the situation]

Background:
[Relevant details and history]

Options Considered:
1. Option A - Pros/cons
2. Option B - Pros/cons
3. Option C - Pros/cons

Recommendation:
[Your recommended option and why]

Deadline:
[When decision needed]

Request:
I need your guidance/decision on this matter.

## Conflict Resolution

### Types of Conflicts

**Technical Disagreement**
- Two approaches to solve a problem
- Different opinions on best practice
- Architecture vs practicality trade-offs

**Interpersonal**
- Misunderstanding between team members
- Different communication styles
- Work style conflicts

**Process**
- Disagreement on how to work
- Different priority opinions
- Schedule/deadline conflicts

### Resolution Framework

**Step 1: Understand**
- Listen to all perspectives
- Ask clarifying questions
- Make sure you understand fully

**Step 2: Find Common Ground**
- What do you agree on?
- What's the shared goal?
- What principles matter to everyone?

**Step 3: Generate Options**
- Brainstorm solutions
- Consider compromises
- Look for win-wins

**Step 4: Evaluate Options**
- Pros and cons of each
- Impact on team and project
- Feasibility

**Step 5: Decide & Commit**
- Make clear decision
- Communicate rationale
- Move forward together

### Example Conflict Resolution

```markdown
Conflict: Should we use TypeScript or JavaScript?

Step 1: Understand
- Developer A: Wants TypeScript (type safety, tooling)
- Developer B: Wants JavaScript (simpler, less build)

Step 2: Common Ground
- Both want maintainable code
- Both want good developer experience
- Both care about team productivity

Step 3: Options
- TypeScript for all code
- JavaScript with JSDoc types
- Gradual migration approach
- TypeScript for critical files only

Step 4: Evaluate
- Team skill level: Mixed JS/TS
- Project size: Large, growing
- Maintenance cost: Prefer TypeScript
- Onboarding: JavaScript easier

Step 5: Decision
→ Use TypeScript, gradual migration
→ Onboard with pair programming
→ Use JSDoc for transition period
→ Developer B agrees to learn TS

Result: Team adopts TypeScript, both developers support the decision
```

### Escalation Red Flags

If these occur, escalate immediately:
- Repeated disrespect or hostility
- Someone won't commit to decision
- Trust has broken down
- Work is being blocked
- Deadline in jeopardy

## Feedback Culture

### Giving Feedback

**When Giving Feedback:**

```markdown
✓ Be specific (not vague)
✓ Give in private (unless praise)
✓ Focus on behavior (not person)
✓ Suggest improvements
✓ Be respectful and professional
✓ Give timely feedback
✓ Acknowledge good work

✗ Don't be vague: "Your work isn't good"
✗ Don't embarrass publicly: "This is terrible"
✗ Don't attack: "You're incompetent"
✗ Don't ignore: "Let me list 10 problems"
✗ Don't postpone: "I'll tell you later"
```

**Feedback Framework:**

```markdown
What I observed:
[Specific situation/behavior]

Impact it had:
[How it affected project/team]

What I'd suggest instead:
[Alternative approach/improvement]

I'd like your thoughts:
[Ask for their perspective]
```

**Example:**

```markdown
What I observed:
In the PR review, you requested changes to the code style
without explaining why the changes were needed.

Impact it had:
The author felt the feedback was unhelpful and asked
multiple clarifying questions.

What I'd suggest instead:
When requesting style changes, include a brief explanation
or link to the style guide so the author understands the reason.

I'd like your thoughts:
Does that make sense? Is there a reason you prefer that approach?
```

### Receiving Feedback

```markdown
✓ Listen fully without interrupting
✓ Ask clarifying questions
✓ Thank them for feedback
✓ Consider their perspective
✓ Respond to feedback
✓ Make changes or explain why not
✓ Follow up and report changes

✗ Don't get defensive
✗ Don't dismiss feedback
✗ Don't make excuses
✗ Don't ignore feedback
✗ Don't retaliate
```

### Feedback Cadence

```markdown
Weekly 1-on-1s:
- Regular feedback opportunity
- Safe space for discussion
- Address issues early

Monthly Retrospectives:
- Team-wide feedback
- Process improvements
- Recognition of good work
