## PR Title Format

### Title Structure

Follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject> | Fixes #<issue-number>
```

### Title Examples

**✓ Good Titles:**
```
feat(auth): implement JWT token validation | Fixes #234
fix(dashboard): resolve widget overlap on mobile | Fixes #567
docs(api): add webhook documentation | Fixes #890
refactor(database): extract connection pooling | Related to #345
perf(search): optimize query with indexing | Fixes #123
test(components): add Button component tests
ci(workflows): add performance benchmarks
chore(deps): upgrade React to 18.2.0
```

**✗ Bad Titles:**
```
fixes stuff
update file
work in progress
changes
dashboard fix
Implement feature
Updated multiple files
Another hotfix
```

### Title Rules

```markdown
✓ Keep under 72 characters
✓ Use lowercase (except proper nouns)
✓ Start with type: feat, fix, docs, refactor, perf, test, ci, chore
✓ Include scope in parentheses
✓ End with issue reference: | Fixes #123
✓ Use imperative mood
✓ Be specific about what changed

✗ Don't use periods at the end
✗ Don't capitalize first letter
✗ Don't write complete sentences
✗ Don't be vague (e.g., "fix bugs")
```

```

### Template Example

```markdown
## Description
Implemented JWT token validation for all API endpoints. The validation
checks token signature and expiration time on every request before
processing.

## Motivation
Current implementation skips token validation in some edge cases,
creating security vulnerability. This fix ensures all requests are
properly validated.

## Changes Made
- Added `validateToken()` method to AuthService
- Added `TokenExpiredError` exception class
- Updated API middleware to validate all requests
- Added retry logic for transient validation failures
- Created comprehensive unit tests

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests added (validateToken, error handling)
- [x] Integration tests with mock JWT tokens
- [x] Manual testing on staging environment
- [x] Verified backward compatibility

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows style guidelines
- [x] Self-review completed
- [x] Comments added for token validation logic
- [x] API documentation updated
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] All tests pass (95% coverage)
- [x] No console errors or warnings

## Related Issues
Fixes #234 (Token validation)
Relates to #567 (Security audit)
Unblocks #890 (Auth feature)

## Deployment Notes
No special deployment steps needed. Can be deployed with existing
database. Token validation enabled by default but can be disabled
via AUTH_VALIDATE_TOKENS environment variable if needed.

## Screenshots
Before: Requests processed without token validation
After: All requests validated before processing
```

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

**Required for:**
- New functions/methods
- Modified existing logic
- Bug fixes
- Edge cases

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('AuthService.validateToken', () => {
  it('should validate valid token', () => {
    const token = createValidToken();
    expect(() => authService.validateToken(token)).not.toThrow();
  });

  it('should throw on expired token', () => {
    const token = createExpiredToken();
    expect(() => authService.validateToken(token)).toThrow(TokenExpiredError);
  });

  it('should throw on invalid signature', () => {
    const token = createTokenWithBadSignature();
    expect(() => authService.validateToken(token)).toThrow(InvalidTokenError);
  });

  it('should handle null token', () => {
    expect(() => authService.validateToken(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

**Required for:**
- Multi-component interactions
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- External service calls

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('API Token Validation', () => {
  it('should reject request without token', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users')
      .expect(401);
  });

  it('should accept request with valid token', async () => {
    const token = createValidToken();
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .expect(200);
  });

  it('should reject request with expired token', async () => {
    const token = createExpiredToken();
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/users')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .expect(401);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

**Minimum requirements:**
- New code: 80% coverage
- Modified code: 80% coverage
- Overall: No decrease in project coverage

**Verify coverage:**
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
# Should show 80%+ for new/modified files
```

## Merge Strategy

### Merge Options

**Option 1: Squash and Merge (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Advantages:
- Clean linear history
- One commit per feature
- Easy to revert if needed
- Clear commit messages

Use for: Most PRs (features, fixes, docs)

Result in main:
- One commit: "feat(auth): add token validation"
- All changes combined
```

**Option 2: Rebase and Merge**
```
Advantages:
- Linear history
- Keeps individual commits
- Clear atomic commits

Use for: Multi-commit PRs with logical separation

Result in main:
- Commit 1: "feat(auth): create TokenValidator class"
- Commit 2: "feat(auth): add validation middleware"
- Commit 3: "test(auth): add unit tests"
```

**Option 3: Create Merge Commit (NOT RECOMMENDED)**
```
Advantages:
- Preserves branch history

Disadvantages:
- Clutters history with merge commits
- Harder to bisect bugs

Use for: Only if explicitly needed

Result in main:
- Merge commit: "Merge pull request #234"
- Plus all original commits
```

### Merge Checklist

Before merging, verify:

```markdown
□ PR title follows format
□ PR description is complete
□ All tests pass
□ All checks pass (CI/CD)
□ Code review approved
□ Branch is up-to-date with base branch
□ No conflicts
□ No console errors/warnings
□ Documentation updated
□ Related issues linked
□ Breaking changes documented
□ Deployment instructions clear
```

### Squash Commit Best Practices

When squashing, the final commit message should be:

```markdown
✓ Clear and descriptive
✓ One logical change
✓ Follows conventional commit format
✓ Includes context for future debugging

Example squashed commit:
"feat(auth): implement JWT token validation with expiration checks"
```

## PR Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ✗ Too Large PRs

```markdown
Problem: PR with 50+ files changed
- Hard to review thoroughly
- Takes longer to review
- Higher chance of bugs

Solution: Break into smaller PRs
- One feature per PR
- Aim for < 400 lines changed
- Group related changes only
```

### ✗ Missing Description

```markdown
Problem: PR with no description
- Reviewers don't know what changed
- Hard to understand purpose

Solution: Always fill PR template
- Explain what and why
- Link related issues
- Add test notes
```

### ✗ Outdated Branch

```markdown
Problem: Feature branch 10 commits behind develop
- Merge conflicts
- Old base
- Inconsistent behavior

Solution: Keep branch updated
- Rebase weekly
- Before submitting PR
- Merge conflicts addressed
```

### ✗ No Tests

```markdown
Problem: PR with code changes but no tests
- No verification of behavior
- Regressions possible
- Hard to maintain

Solution: Always add tests
- 80% coverage minimum
- Test happy path and edge cases
- Include error handling tests
```

### ✗ Mixing Unrelated Changes

```markdown
Problem: PR mixing feature, refactor, and style fixes
- Hard to review
- Hard to revert specific changes
- Unclear purpose

Solution: One concern per PR
- Feature PR = feature only
- Refactor PR = refactor only
- Style PR = style only
```
