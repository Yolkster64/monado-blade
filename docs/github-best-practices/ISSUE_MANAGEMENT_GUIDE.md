- Duplicated code across endpoints

Proposed Solution:
Create separate AuthService class with:
- Login/logout methods
- Token validation
- Session management

This refactoring will:
- Improve testability
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability

Complexity: Medium
Labels: refactor, tech-debt
Milestone: v1.3.0
Priority: Medium
```

### Documentation
**When:** Documentation is missing or outdated

```markdown
Title: "docs: Add API documentation for webhooks"

Description:
Webhook feature exists but lacks documentation.

Missing Documentation:
- [ ] Webhook setup guide
- [ ] Event types and payloads
- [ ] Retry strategy
- [ ] Examples

Labels: documentation
Priority: Medium
Assignee: Documentation Team
```

### Spike/Investigation
**When:** Research or exploration needed

```markdown
Title: "spike: Evaluate authentication libraries"

Description:
Investigate available JWT libraries for Node.js

Objectives:
- Compare popular JWT libraries
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations
- Integration complexity

Success Criteria:

## Actual Behavior
What actually happened

## Environment
- Browser: [e.g. Chrome]
- OS: [e.g. Windows 10]
- Version: [e.g. 1.2.0]

## Screenshots
If applicable

## Additional Context
Any other context
```

**feature-request.md:**
```markdown
---
name: Feature Request
about: Suggest a new feature
title: "[FEATURE] "
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''
---

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
Describe the problem. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

## Labeling Strategy

### Core Labels

| Label | Color | When to Use |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **bug** | 🔴 Red | Something is broken |
| **enhancement** | 🟢 Green | New feature or improvement |
| **documentation** | 🔵 Blue | Docs updates needed |
| **refactor** | 🟣 Purple | Code quality improvement |
| **test** | 🟤 Brown | Testing or coverage |
| **security** | 🟠 Orange | Security-related |
| **performance** | 🟡 Yellow | Performance improvement |
| **accessibility** | 🟢 Green | A11y improvements |
| **chore** | ⚪ Gray | Maintenance tasks |
| **help wanted** | 🔵 Blue | Open for contributors |
| **good first issue** | 🟢 Green | Good for new contributors |

### Priority Labels

| Label | Meaning | Response Time |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **priority: critical** | Prod down, security issue | Immediate (< 1 hour) |
| **priority: high** | Major functionality broken | ASAP (< 4 hours) |
| **priority: medium** | Important but not blocking | < 24 hours |
| **priority: low** | Nice to have | Within sprint |

### Status Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **status: investigation** | Being investigated |
| **status: in-progress** | Actively being worked on |
| **status: blocked** | Can't proceed (reason in comment) |
| **status: review** | Waiting for code review |
| **status: waiting** | Waiting for external input |
| **status: needs-info** | More information requested |

### Area Labels

| Label | Area |
|-------|------|
| **area: api** | API functionality |

### Multi-Line Label Rules

```markdown
✓ Use 2-3 labels per issue (not more)
✓ Always include type label (bug, enhancement, etc.)
✓ Add priority if clear
✓ Add area if known
✗ Don't over-label (causes noise)
✗ Don't use labels instead of descriptions

Example good labeling:
- bug, priority: high, area: api

Example over-labeling:
- bug, priority: high, critical, urgent, needs-fix, please-fix, etc.
```

### Creating Labels

```markdown
## Standard Label Set to Create

Core Types:
- bug (Red)

### Priority Definitions

**Critical (P0)**
- Production is down or severely impaired
- Security vulnerability
- Data loss risk
- Revenue impact
- Response time: Immediate (< 1 hour)
- SLA: Fix within 4 hours

```markdown
Example:
- "Authentication service is down"
- "Database is corrupted"
- "Security breach discovered"
```

**High (P1)**
- Important feature broken
- Major functionality impaired
- Affects multiple users
- Response time: ASAP (< 4 hours)
- SLA: Fix within 24 hours

```markdown
Example:
- "Dashboard doesn't load for logged-in users"
- "Export feature broken"
- "Search results incorrect"
```

**Medium (P2)**
- Normal functionality degraded
- Affects some users
- Workaround exists
- Response time: < 24 hours
- SLA: Fix within sprint

```markdown
Example:
- "Mobile view slightly misaligned"
- "Report generation is slow"
- "Help text could be clearer"
```

**Low (P3)**
- Nice to have
- Doesn't affect core functionality
- No workaround needed
- Response time: Within sprint
- SLA: Fix when time permits

```markdown
Example:
- "Improve button styling"
- "Add dark mode"
- "Update sample code"
```

### Determining Priority Decision Tree

```
Is production down or data at risk?
├─ YES → Priority: Critical (P0)
└─ NO → Does it block users from working?
        ├─ YES → Does it affect all users?
        │       ├─ YES → Priority: High (P1)
        │       └─ NO → Priority: Medium (P2)
        └─ NO → Does it improve experience?
                ├─ YES, significantly → Priority: Medium (P2)
                └─ NO or minor → Priority: Low (P3)
```
