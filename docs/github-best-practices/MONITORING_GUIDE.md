## Dashboard Monitoring

### GitHub Health Dashboard

Monitor in GitHub repository:

```markdown
Metrics to track:
├─ Code Quality
│  ├─ Test coverage
│  ├─ Linting issues
│  ├─ CodeQL alerts
│  └─ Security vulnerabilities
├─ Velocity
│  ├─ PRs merged per week
│  ├─ Issues closed per week
│  ├─ Average cycle time
│  └─ Lead time
├─ Health
│  ├─ Open issues (by priority)
│  ├─ Open PRs (age)
│  ├─ Blocked items
│  └─ Backlog size
└─ Activity
   ├─ Commits per week
   ├─ Contributors active
   ├─ CI/CD success rate
   └─ Deployment frequency
```

### Create Custom Dashboard

Use GitHub Insights → Graphs:

```markdown
Available Graphs:
- Network: Branch visualization
- Commits: Commit history
- Code frequency: Changes over time
- Pulse: Activity summary
- Dependents: Projects using this
- Community: Contributor stats
```

### Dashboard Checks (Daily)

```markdown
Every morning (5 minutes):
□ Check failed CI/CD runs
□ Check new security alerts
□ Check open issues count
□ Review high-priority items
□ Check test coverage trend

Weekly review (30 minutes):
□ Metrics dashboard
□ Dependency scan results
□ Security scanning results
□ Performance trends
□ Team velocity
```

## Alert Setup

### GitHub Notifications

Configure notification settings:

```markdown
Alerts to enable:
✓ Vulnerability alerts
✓ Dependabot alerts
✓ CodeQL scanning alerts
✓ Pull request status checks
✓ Security advisories
✓ Repository access changes

Where to send:
- Critical: Slack + Email
- High: Slack
- Medium: Email digest
- Low: Dashboard only
```

### Slack Notifications

Configure GitHub Actions notifications:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Send Slack notification
  if: failure()
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  with:
    payload: |
      {
        "text": "Workflow failed: ${{ github.workflow }}",
        "blocks": [
          {
            "type": "section",
            "text": {
              "type": "mrkdwn",
              "text": "Workflow: ${{ github.workflow }}\nStatus: ${{ job.status }}"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
```

### Alert Response Time

| Alert | Severity | Response | Action |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Security Vulnerability | Critical | 30 min | Patch immediately |
| Test Failure | High | 2 hours | Investigate and fix |
| Deployment Failure | High | 1 hour | Investigate |
| Code Quality Drop | Medium | 4 hours | Review and fix |
| Dependency Update | Low | 24 hours | Review and merge |

## Security Scanning

### Automated Security Scans

Enable GitHub security features:

```markdown
Code Scanning:
✓ CodeQL (GitHub default)
✓ Semantic (optional)
✓ SonarQube (optional)

Dependency Scanning:
✓ Dependabot
✓ npm audit
✓ Snyk (optional)

Secret Scanning:
✓ GitHub Secret Scanning
✓ GitGuardian (optional)

SBOM (Software Bill of Materials):
✓ Dependency manifest
✓ License scanning
✓ Vulnerability tracking
```

### Security Audit Schedule

```markdown
Daily:
□ Review new vulnerability alerts
□ Check secret scanning results

Weekly:
□ Review CodeQL findings
□ Review dependency updates
□ Check for exposed secrets

Monthly:
□ Full security audit
□ Dependency update review
□ License compliance check
□ Access control review

Quarterly:
□ Penetration testing
□ Security training
□ Policy review
□ Incident review
```

### Responding to Findings

```markdown
For each vulnerability:

Severity: Critical
□ Patch within 24 hours
□ Deploy immediately
□ Notify users if needed
□ Document incident

Severity: High
□ Plan patch within 1 week
□ Deploy to staging first
□ Test thoroughly

Severity: Medium
□ Schedule fix in sprint
□ Plan rollout
□ Test on staging

Severity: Low
□ Add to backlog
□ Fix when time permits
□ No urgency required
```

---

## Dependency Updates

### Update Strategy

```markdown
Frequency:
- Critical: Immediately
- Security: Within 1 week
- Major: Monthly
- Minor: Weekly
- Patch: Daily (auto-merge if tests pass)

Testing Before Update:
□ Run full test suite
□ Check for breaking changes
□ Review changelog
□ Verify compatibility

Testing After Update:
□ Run full test suite again
□ Manual smoke test
□ Check for performance regression
□ Monitor for issues (24 hours)
```

### Dependabot Configuration

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Daily checks for npm dependencies
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: daily
      time: "03:00"
    
    # Group updates by type
    groups:
      production:
        dependency-type: production
      development:
        dependency-type: development
    
    # Auto-merge minor updates with tests passing
    auto-merge:
      type: all
      target-branch: develop
```

### Version Constraints

```bash
# Recommended constraints in package.json

# Allow patch updates only (stable)
"express": "4.18.2"

# Allow minor and patch (compatible)
"react": "^18.2.0"

# Allow major updates (risky)
"lodash": "*"

# Pin exact version (strict)
"critical-package": "1.0.0"

# Best practice for production:
"express": "~4.18.2"  # Allow patches
"react": "^18.2.0"    # Allow minor+patch
```
