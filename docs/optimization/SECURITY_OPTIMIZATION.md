## Executive Summary

Optimize HELIOS Platform security posture through continuous scanning, access control, encryption, and compliance.

---

## 1. Security Hardening

### Baseline Assessment
- Vulnerabilities found: 5-15 per scan
- Resolution time: <24 hours for critical
- Security score: 75/100

### Hardening Procedures

```powershell
# Run security baseline
Invoke-SecurityBaseline -Platform "HELIOS" -Detailed

# Verify compliance
Test-ComplianceRequirements -Standard "SOC2,GDPR"
```

---

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning

```yaml
security:
  dependency_scanning: true
  code_scanning: true
  secret_scanning: true
  container_scanning: true
  sast:
    enabled: true
    tools:
      - Roslyn Analyzers
      - SonarQube
```

---

## 3. Access Control

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard() { }

[Authorize(Roles = "Developer")]
public IActionResult DeploymentPanel() { }

[AllowAnonymous]
public IActionResult PublicStatus() { }
```

---

## 4. Encryption

- Data at rest: AES-256
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3
- Key rotation: Every 90 days

---

## 5. Audit Logging

All access logged with:
- User ID
- Timestamp
- Action performed
- Resource accessed
- Success/failure status
