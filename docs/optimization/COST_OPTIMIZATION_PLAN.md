## 2. GitHub Actions Optimization

### 2.1 Build Minutes Reduction

#### Current State
```
Metrics:
- Builds per month:      300
- Minutes per build:     26
- Total minutes:         7,800
- Cost:                  $78/month
```

#### Optimization Strategy

| Optimization | Savings | Effort |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| Parallel builds (-55%) | $43 | 2h |
| Cache optimization (-60% restore) | $15 | 1h |
| Skip unnecessary jobs (-20%) | $15 | 1h |
| Early exit on failure (-10%) | $8 | 30min |
| **Total** | **$81/month** | **4.5h** |

#### Implementation

```powershell
# 1. Parallel matrix builds
# Reduce from sequential (26 min) to parallel (12 min)

# 2. NuGet cache
# Reduce restore from 5 min to 30 sec

# 3. Skip docs-only changes
# Skip 60 builds/month = 1,560 minutes saved

# 4. Early failure exit
# Reduce average failure time
```

**Monthly Savings: $81**
**Annual Savings: $972**

### 2.2 Build Strategy

```yaml
# Implement smarter build strategy

PR builds (100/month):
- Only essential frameworks
- Limited test suite
- Time: 8 min → 5 min
- Cost: $50 → $30 (40% savings)

Develop branch (100/month):
- All frameworks
- Full test suite
- Time: 26 min → 12 min
- Cost: $50 → $24 (52% savings)

Main branch (50/month):
- Full test + E2E
- Generate release artifacts
- Time: 35 min → 18 min
- Cost: $45 → $23 (49% savings)

Scheduled tests (20/month):
- Full E2E suite
- Performance tests
- Time: 40 min
- Cost: $13 → $13 (no change)
```

**Total GitHub Actions Savings:**
```
Before:  $78/month × 12 = $936/year
After:   $30/month × 12 = $360/year
Savings: $576/year (62%)
```

---

## 3. Storage Optimization

### 3.1 Artifact Management

#### Current Strategy
```
All artifacts retained: 30 days
Average size: 50 GB at any time
Storage cost: $25/month
```

#### Optimized Strategy

```powershell
# 1. Reduce retention period
30 days → 7 days: -75% storage

# 2. Compress artifacts
Before: 95 MB per build
After:  45 MB per build (47% reduction)

# 3. Archive old builds
Move to cheaper storage after 7 days

# 4. Selective upload
Skip debug builds, keep only releases
```

**Storage Optimization:**

| Change | Impact | Savings |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Reduce retention (30→7 days) | -75% | $18.75 |
| Compression (95MB→45MB) | -53% | $6.50 |
| Archive strategy | -20% | $2.50 |
| **Total** | **-85%** | **$23.75** |

**Storage Costs:**
```
Before:  $25/month × 12 = $300/year
After:   $1.25/month × 12 = $15/year
Savings: $285/year (95%)
```

---

## 4. Bandwidth Optimization

### 4.1 Bandwidth Reduction Strategy

#### Current Usage
```
Artifact downloads:      25/month × 2 MB = 50 GB
API responses:          5,000/month
Log transfer:           100 GB/month
Total:                  ~$50/month
```

#### Optimization

```powershell
# 1. CDN caching
Cache static artifacts: -60% bandwidth

# 2. Response compression
Gzip responses: -50% bandwidth

# 3. Request batching
Batch API calls: -40% requests

# 4. Log optimization
Reduce log verbosity: -70% log size
```

**Bandwidth Reduction:**

| Strategy | Current | Optimized | Savings |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Artifact CDN | $25 | $10 | $15 |
| API compression | $15 | $5 | $10 |
| Log optimization | $10 | $3 | $7 |
| **Total** | **$50** | **$18** | **$32** |

**Bandwidth Savings:**
```
Before:  $50/month × 12 = $600/year
After:   $18/month × 12 = $216/year
Savings: $384/year (64%)
```

## 5. Compute Resource Optimization

### 5.1 Runner Optimization

#### Standard Runner Costs
```
Ubuntu runner: $0.01 per minute (included in GitHub billing)
```

#### Optimization
```
1. Batch similar jobs
2. Use matrix builds efficiently
3. Conditional execution (skip unnecessary jobs)
4. Parallel execution (reduce total time)
```

**Expected Savings: 50-60% compute time**

public class CostTracker {
    public class MonthlyMetrics {
        public DateTime Month { get; set; }
        public decimal GitHubActionsCost { get; set; }
        public decimal StorageCost { get; set; }
        public decimal BandwidthCost { get; set; }
        public decimal TotalCost { get; set; }
        public decimal SavingsVsTarget { get; set; }

    public List<MonthlyMetrics> GetMonthlyMetrics(int lastMonths = 12) {
        return GetCostHistory(lastMonths);
    }
    
    public MonthlyMetrics GetCurrentMonth() {
        return new MonthlyMetrics {

            GitHubActionsCost = CalculateGitHubCost(),
            StorageCost = CalculateStorageCost(),
            BandwidthCost = CalculateBandwidthCost(),
            TotalCost = CalculateTotalCost(),
            SavingsVsTarget = CalculateSavingsVsTarget()
        };
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Monthly Monitoring

```powershell
function Get-CostReport {
    param(

    )
    
    $github = Get-GitHubActionsCost -Month $Month
    $storage = Get-StorageCost -Month $Month
    $bandwidth = Get-BandwidthCost -Month $Month
    
    $report = @"
Cost Report - $(Get-Date -Month $Month -Format 'MMMM')
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
GitHub Actions:    $github (Target: $30)
Artifact Storage:  $storage (Target: $1.25)
Bandwidth:         $bandwidth (Target: $18)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
