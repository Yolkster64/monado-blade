## Part 2: Rollback Strategy

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Triggers**:
1. ❌ Security vulnerability discovered
2. ❌ Data corruption issues
3. ❌ Installation failure rate > 5%
4. ❌ Critical feature broken
5. ❌ Widespread compatibility issues
6. ❌ Performance regression > 50%

**Delayed Rollback Triggers**:
1. ⚠️ Minor bugs discovered in first 24 hours
2. ⚠️ Documentation errors
3. ⚠️ UI/UX issues
4. ⚠️ Platform-specific problems

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Issue Type | Response |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| 🔴 Critical | Security / Data Loss / Universal Failure | Immediate Rollback |
| 🟠 High | Widespread Failures / Major Features Broken | Rollback within 1 hour |
| 🟡 Medium | Limited Failures / Some Users Affected | Hotfix (v1.0.1) |
| 🟢 Low | Minor Issues / Cosmetic / Few Users Affected | Keep Release + Document |

### Rollback Procedure

#### Step 1: Declare Rollback
```powershell
# Notify all stakeholders
Write-Host "ROLLBACK DECLARED: v1.0.0"
Write-Host "Reason: [State specific reason]"
Write-Host "Rollback Target: [Previous stable version or remove]"
Write-Host "Timeline: Immediate to 1 hour"
```

**Actions**:
- [ ] Notify engineering team
- [ ] Notify support team
- [ ] Notify product management
- [ ] Create incident ticket
- [ ] Update status page

#### Step 2: Stop Distribution

```powershell
# 1. Unlist from NuGet.org
$nugetApiKey = $env:NUGET_API_KEY
nuget delete HELIOS.Platform 1.0.0 -Source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -ApiKey $nugetApiKey

# 2. Mark GitHub Release as retracted
# Via GitHub UI: Release Edit → Mark as retracted

# 3. Request Chocolatey delisting
# Contact: Chocolatey moderation team

# 4. Retract Winget submission
# Withdraw PR from microsoft/winget-pkgs
```

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] NuGet package unlisted
- [ ] GitHub Release marked retracted
- [ ] Chocolatey package flagged/removed
- [ ] Winget PR closed
- [ ] Download links disabled
- [ ] Monitor for cached versions

#### Step 3: Notify Users

```powershell
# Create urgent notification
$notification = @"
