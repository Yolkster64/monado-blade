## Task Management

### Story Template

```markdown
# Story Title

## User Story
As a [user type]
I want to [capability]
So that [business value]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code written & reviewed
- [ ] Tests passing (85%+ coverage)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo-ready
- [ ] Merged to main

## Complexity
- [Simple/Medium/Complex]

## Phase
- [0/1/2/3]

## Effort
- [X points]
```

### Task Assignment

**Assignment Process:**

1. **Discuss** - Team understands task
2. **Estimate** - Estimate effort (points)
3. **Assign** - Assign to person who volunteers or has capacity
4. **Commit** - Assignee confirms doable in sprint
5. **Track** - Update status daily

**Task Status Workflow:**

```
Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done

- Backlog: Not ready for sprint
- Ready: Meets Definition of Ready
- In Progress: Developer working on it
- Review: PR open, waiting review
- Done: Merged & tested
```

## Metrics & Health Checks

### Sprint Velocity

**Calculate:**
```
Week 1: 20 points
Week 2: 15 points
Sprint Total: 35 points

Velocity: 35 points/sprint
Trend: Stable or improving?
```

**Interpretation:**
- Stable velocity (±10%): Team is healthy
- Increasing: Team improving
- Decreasing: Blockers or burnout?

### Team Health Indicators

| Burndown | Smooth | Steep | Investigate |
| Attendance | 100% | <95% | Check-in |
| Morale | High | Declining | 1-on-1s |
| Blockers | <2 | >5 | Daily resolution |

   "How did it go?"
   "What did you learn?"
