## Current Status

✅ 4+ GitHub Actions workflows deployed  
✅ Build pipeline operational (5 min avg)  
✅ Test automation running (85%+ coverage)  
✅ Deployment automation verified  
✅ All notifications configured  

## Key Workflows

### 1. Build Workflow (.github/workflows/build.yml)
- Triggers: Push to main, PR creation
- Duration: 3-5 minutes
- Actions: Compile, package, store artifacts

### 2. Test Workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml)
- Triggers: Push to main, PR creation
- Duration: 10-15 minutes
- Coverage: 85%+
- Runs on: Multiple OS versions

### 3. Deploy Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- Triggers: Release tag created
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Targets: Staging, then production
- Safety: Automatic rollback on failure

### 4. Publish Workflow (.github/workflows/publish.yml)
- Triggers: Version bump detected
- Duration: 5 minutes
- Destination: NuGet.org
- Verification: Post-publish checks
