## Advanced Field Configuration

### Custom Field Scripting

For fields that need dynamic calculation or special handling:

```javascript
// Example: Auto-calculate Estimated Days based on Effort
function calculateEstimatedDays(effortPoints) {
  const baseRate = 40; // points per week
  const workingDaysPerWeek = 5;
  
  // Points to days conversion
  const developmentDays = (effortPoints / baseRate) * workingDaysPerWeek;
  
  // Add overhead: planning, review, testing
  const overheadMultiplier = 1.3;
  const totalDays = Math.ceil(developmentDays * overheadMultiplier);
  
  return totalDays;
}

// In board automation:
// IF Effort Estimate changes THEN Estimated Days = calculateEstimatedDays(effort)
```

### Field Validation Rules

```yaml
Validation Rules:
  
  Priority:
    - Must be one of: Critical, High, Medium, Low
    - Default: Medium
    - Cannot be blank for active issues
    
  Component:
    - Must be one of predefined values
    - Cannot be blank for any issue
    - Changing component re-triggers Rule 4
    
  Effort Estimate:
    - Only Fibonacci sequence allowed: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
    - Cannot be 0
    - Leave blank if unsure (instead of estimating wrong)
    
  Status Phase:
    - Must be Phase 0-7
    - Default: Phase 0
    - Changing should notify phase lead
    
  Dates:
    - Start Date must be before Target Date
    - Target Date cannot be in past (unless completed)
    - Validate dates make sense for phase
```

## Advanced Automation Configuration

### Custom Automation Rules (Beyond the 4 Standard)

**Rule 5: Auto-Assign to Phase Based on Dependencies**

```yaml
name: Advanced Dependency-Based Assignment

trigger: Issue created or updated

condition: |
  Issue has "depends-on: #XXX" in description
  AND referenced issue #XXX is in Phase N

action:
  Set Status Phase = N + 1 (next phase after dependency)
  Add comment: "Auto-assigned to Phase N+1 (depends on #XXX)"
  Notify: Phase N+1 lead

example:
  Issue: "Deploy Phase 1 to staging"
  Dependencies: "depends-on: #123 (Phase 0 complete)"
  System Auto-assigns: Phase 1
```

**Rule 6: Auto-Escalate Stalled Issues**

```yaml
name: Auto-Escalate Stalled Issues

trigger: Daily at 9 AM

condition: |
  Issue in In Progress column for > 4 days
  OR Issue in Review column for > 2 days
  Status not updated in 24 hours

action:
  Add label: "stalled"
  Increase priority level
  Add comment: "@lead This issue appears stalled"
  Notify: Assignee + Lead

example:
  Issue #456 in Review for 3 days
  No updates in 24 hours
  System labels: "stalled"
  Escalates to High priority (if Medium)
  Notifies team and lead
```

**Rule 7: Auto-Create Follow-Up Issues**

```yaml
name: Auto-Create Follow-Up Issues

trigger: Issue moved to Done

condition: |
  Issue has "follow-up: [description]" in description
  OR Issue labeled with "has-follow-up"

action:
  Create new issue with:
    Title: "[Follow-up] Original Issue Title"
    Description: [Follow-up description from parent]
    Depends-on: Parent issue
    Phase: Parent phase + 1
    Priority: Same as parent
  Link to parent issue
  Notify: Original assignee

example:
  Issue #456 Done: "Implement auth"
  Has follow-up: "Performance optimization"
  System creates: Issue #789 "Follow-up: Implement auth (perf optimization)"
  Linked to #456
  Assigned to same person
```

### Advanced Workflow Conditions

**Multi-Condition Automation:**

```yaml
Scenario: Only mark Done if ALL criteria met

Conditions:
  1. PR is merged (check PR status)
  2. All checkboxes in description are checked (parse description)
  3. No open pull requests (check open PRs)
  4. Deployment status is "success" (check deployment status)
  5. Performance tests passed (check test results)
  6. Security scan passed (check security scan)
  7. No open conversations (check comments)

Action: Move to Done ONLY if ALL conditions = true

This prevents premature closing and ensures quality
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database & Query Optimization

```
Optimization Strategies:

1. Archive Old Issues
   - Archive completed issues > 30 days old
   - Reduces active issue count
   - Improves board load time
   - Keeps historical data searchable
   - Recommended: Run weekly

2. Index Frequently Filtered Fields
   - Priority (most filtered)
   - Component (most grouped)
   - Status Phase (for phase view)
   - Reduces query time by 50-70%

3. Denormalize for Speed
   - Pre-calculate metrics
   - Cache tier assignments
   - Pre-group by component
   - Faster board load times

4. Implement Search Cache
   - Cache recent searches
   - Return results instantly
   - Reduces server load
   - Implement 5-minute TTL
```

### Load Testing

```
Simulate 1,000 issues on board:

Expected Performance:
- Board load time: 1-2 seconds
- Drag-drop response: <200ms
- Filter application: <500ms
- Automation rule execution: 1-2 seconds

Test Procedure:
1. Create 1,000 test issues
2. Apply varied fields
3. Apply filters
4. Measure load time
5. Identify bottlenecks
6. Optimize critical paths
```

---

## Scalability Planning

### For Growing Teams

**Current Configuration Supports:**
- 200-300 concurrent users
- 1,000+ issues
- 8 views
- 4 automation rules
- 25 custom fields
- Real-time sync

**Scaling to 500 Users:**

```
Changes Needed:
1. Increase board refresh frequency (currently 5 min)
   → May need optimization
2. Add read replicas for board queries
3. Implement issue caching layer
4. Archive older phases
5. Split into multiple boards by phase

Estimated Impact:
- Load time: +100-200ms
- Automation latency: +1-2 seconds
- Still well within acceptable limits
```

**Scaling to 1,000+ Users:**

```
Recommended Architecture:
1. Split board by component (7 boards instead of 1)
2. Central dashboard aggregates metrics
3. Separate automation runners
4. Caching layer for board data
5. Real-time update system (WebSocket)

Estimated Cost:
- Infrastructure: +$500-1000/month
- Maintenance: +20 hours/month
- Performance gain: 300-500% improvement
```

## Integration Extensions

### JIRA Bi-Directional Sync

```
Setup Integration:

1. Install JIRA GitHub App
2. Configure webhook for GitHub
3. Configure webhook for JIRA
4. Map fields between systems

GitHub Issue ↔ JIRA Ticket
Field Mappings:
  - Title ↔ Summary
  - Description ↔ Description
  - Priority ↔ Priority
  - Assignee ↔ Assignee
  - Status ↔ Status (custom mapping)
  - Component ↔ Component
  - Labels ↔ Labels

Sync Frequency: Real-time
Conflict Resolution: GitHub takes precedence
Testing: Sync 10 test issues first

Benefits:
- Single source of truth across systems
- Seamless integration
- No data loss
```

### Slack Integration Advanced

```
Setup Custom Notifications:

Trigger: Issue moves to Review
Action: Post to Slack
Channel: #code-reviews
Message:
  PR #789 ready for review
  Issue: Implement dark mode
  Reviewer: @jane
  Complexity: Medium

Trigger: Critical blocker added
Action: Post to Slack
Channel: #incidents
@channel Issue #456 BLOCKED: Auth system down
Assigned to: @john
Action required: URGENT

Trigger: Milestone reached
Action: Post to Slack
Channel: #announcements
🎉 Phase 2 Complete! 40 issues done this week
```

## API Access & Automation

### GitHub Projects GraphQL API

```graphql
# Query to get all issues in specific phase
query {
  repository(owner: "helios", name: "platform") {
    projectV2(number: 1) {
      items(first: 100, filter: {phase: "Phase 2"}) {
        nodes {
          content {
            ... on Issue {
              title
              number
              customFields {
                priority
                component
                effort
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Use cases:
- Export board data for reporting
- Sync to external systems
- Generate custom reports
- Audit trail analysis
```

### REST API Examples

```bash
# Get all issues in component
curl -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/helios/platform/issues?labels=component-gui

# Create issue programmatically
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/helios/platform/issues \
  -d '{
    "title": "New Feature",
    "body": "Feature description",
    "labels": ["phase-1", "component-gui"],
    "assignees": ["user1"]
  }'

# Update issue field
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/helios/platform/issues/456 \
  -d '{"state": "closed"}'
```
