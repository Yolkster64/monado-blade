## Template Best Practices

### DO

- ✓ **Customize for your context:** Replace [bracketed items] with specific details
- ✓ **Break into sub-issues:** Create separate issues for each subtask
- ✓ **Keep team informed:** Share phase plan at kickoff
- ✓ **Track progress:** Update issue status and metrics weekly
- ✓ **Document decisions:** Add notes to issue comments
- ✓ **Get sign-offs:** Complete sign-off checklist before phase completion
- ✓ **Archive completed phases:** Close issue to keep board clean

### DON'T

- ✗ Use template as-is without customization
- ✗ Leave acceptance criteria vague
- ✗ Skip testing and verification
- ✗ Overlook team training
- ✗ Ignore risk register
- ✗ Skip documentation updates
- ✗ Move to next phase without sign-off
- ✗ Abandon phase issue without archiving

### Customization Tips
