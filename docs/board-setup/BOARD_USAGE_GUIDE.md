## Best Practices

### Daily Workflow

```
Morning (9:00 AM):
1. Check My Work view
2. Review due today items
3. Check blockers
4. Update status for current work
5. Plan your day

During Day:
1. Move completed items to In Progress
2. Create PR when ready
3. Update issue when PR ready for review
4. Help unblock teammates

End of Day (5:00 PM):
1. Move completed items to Done
2. Update tomorrow's priorities
3. Note any blockers
4. Review team's progress
```

### Estimation Best Practices

**Story Points:**
```
1 point = 1-2 hours of work
2 points = 0.5-1 day of work
3 points = 1-2 days of work
5 points = 2-3 days of work
8 points = 1 week of work
13 points = 2+ weeks of work

Tips:
- Compare to similar past issues
- Account for testing, review, deployment
- Avoid underestimation (causes rushed work)
- Avoid overestimation (seems harder than it is)
```

### Quality Tips

```
Good Issue Descriptions:
✓ Clear problem statement
✓ Context and why it matters
✓ Acceptance criteria with checkboxes
✓ Links to related issues/docs
✓ Expected vs actual behavior (bugs)
✓ Steps to reproduce (bugs)

Bad Issue Descriptions:
✗ "Fix stuff"
✗ No context
✗ Vague criteria
✗ No acceptance criteria
✗ Missing reproduction steps
```

### Communication Tips

```
In Issue Comments:
- Use @mentions to direct to person
- Link related issues with #number
- Post progress updates daily
- Flag blockers immediately
- Ask questions clearly
- Provide context for reviewers

Example:
@john-lead I'm blocked on #456 - need auth design review
See comment on #454 for context.
Can we discuss Thursday?
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Feature

```
Week 1: Planning
1. Create issue "Design: Feature X"
   - Status: Phase 0
   - Priority: High
   - Component: GUI
   - Effort: TBD
   - Acceptance: [Design complete, reviewed, approved]

2. Design phase work
   - Move to In Progress
   - Link design docs
   - Collaborate with team

3. Design review
   - Move to Review
   - Address feedback
   - Get sign-off

Week 2: Implementation
1. Create issue "Implement: Feature X"
   - Depends on design being done
   - Status: Phase 2
   - Component: GUI
   - Effort: 5 points

2. Development
   - Assign to developer
   - Move to In Progress
   - Create PR when ready

3. Review & Merge
   - PR moves to Review (auto)
   - Address feedback
   - Merge when approved
   - Auto moves to Done
```

### Fixing a Bug

```
1. Create issue "Bug: X not working in Y"
   - Priority: High
   - Component: [Affected component]
   - Add reproduction steps
   - Acceptance: [Bug fixed + test added]

2. Investigation
   - Move to In Progress
   - Add diagnosis details as comments
   - Link related issues

3. Fix & Test
   - Create PR with fix
   - Auto moves to Review
   - Include test case
   - Document fix

4. Deploy
   - Merge when approved
   - Auto moves to Done
   - Mark deployment status
```

### Cross-Component Work

```
Scenario: Feature needs UI + Backend

1. Create parent issue "Feature X"
2. Create sub-issues:
   - "Backend: Implement API" (Hub/Stack)
   - "Frontend: Build UI" (GUI)
   - Link them as related
   - Coordinate timelines
   - Don't start frontend until API designed

3. Backend team:
   - Works on API issue
   - Creates design PR
   - Frontend reviews to understand API

4. Frontend team:
   - Uses API design
   - Builds UI
   - Both move through workflow
   - Integrate when both ready

5. Integration:
   - Create integration issue if needed
   - Test together
   - Deploy together
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue Not Appearing on Board

**Check:**
1. Is issue added to project? (Check Projects tab on issue)
2. Is view filtering it out? (Check active filters)
3. Is view showing correct columns? (Check view settings)

**Fix:**
1. Click issue → Projects → Add to HELIOS Platform
2. Remove or modify filters
3. Reset view or try different view

### Status Not Updating

**Check:**
1. Is PR linked correctly? (Check issue comments)
2. Is PR merged? (Check PR status)
3. Are automation rules active? (Check Actions logs)

**Fix:**
1. Link PR manually in issue comments
2. Verify PR is merged (not just approved)
3. Manually move if automation failed

### Custom Fields Not Populating

**Check:**
1. Did you apply labels? (phase-*, component-*)
2. Are labels spelled correctly? (case-sensitive)
3. Is automation rule running?

**Fix:**
1. Apply labels (triggers Rule 1)
2. Check label spelling
3. Manually fill fields if needed
4. Report if persists

### Can't Assign to Team Member

**Check:**
1. Is person a collaborator? (Check repo settings)
2. Have they accepted invitation?
3. Is field accepting this value?

**Fix:**
1. Add person as collaborator first
2. Have them accept invitation
3. Try again
