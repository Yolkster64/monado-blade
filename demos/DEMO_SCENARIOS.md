### Key Classes

**DemoBase**
Abstract base class providing common functionality:
- Log file generation
- Progress tracking
- Metrics collection
- Report generation
- Timing and performance measurement

**Derived Demo Classes**
Each demo inherits from DemoBase and implements:
- `ExecuteDemoAsync()`: Main demo logic
- Specialized methods for demo-specific operations
- Component-specific metrics

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Demos
1. Create new class inheriting from `DemoBase`
2. Implement `ExecuteDemoAsync()`
3. Use inherited logging methods
4. Add to `Program.cs` menu
5. Update documentation

### Modifying Execution Time
- Adjust `await Task.Delay(milliseconds)` values
- Modify component count
- Change phase count

### Customizing Metrics
- Add to `Metrics` dictionary
- Format in report generation
- Export to JSON
