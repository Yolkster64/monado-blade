# HELIOS Platform - Repository Reorganization Report

**Stream 2 of Phase 7: GitHub Repository Reorganization**

**Date**: April 24, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time Spent**: ~45 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully reorganized the helios-platform repository from a flat, scattered structure into a clear, hierarchical organization. All changes were made using `git mv` to preserve the complete commit history. The repository is now significantly more maintainable and navigable.

## Project Reference Updates

### Updated Files (3 .csproj modifications)
1. **HELIOS.Platform.csproj** (root)
   - Updated compile excludes: `src/tests/**/*.cs` (from `tests/**/*.cs`)
   - Updated excludes: `src/core/HELIOS.Platform.Minimal/**/*.cs` (from `src/HELIOS-MINIMAL/**/*.cs`)
   - ✅ Verified all paths are correct

2. **No ProjectReference updates needed**
   - Main projects use relative paths that work with new structure
   - No cross-project .csproj references to update

---

## GitHub Actions Workflows Updated (2 files)

### `.github/workflows/nuget.yml`
- ✅ Fixed merge conflict (removed conflicting branch markers)
- ✅ Updated build path: `src/HELIOS.Platform/` → `src/core/HELIOS.Platform/`
- ✅ Updated test path: `tests/` → `src/tests/`
- ✅ Updated version extraction path in csproj

### `.github/workflows/ci-validation.yml`
- ✅ Updated test directory path: `tests/` → `src/tests/`
- ✅ Updated required documentation paths to new locations
- ✅ Updated directory structure validation to check `/docs/phases`, `/src/core`, `/src/tests`

---

## Build Status

### Pre-Reorganization
- ⚠️ Some build paths may have been pointing to old locations

### Post-Reorganization

✓ No broken old-path references in .csproj files
```

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Empty directories
**Problem**: Some test directories were empty, causing `git mv` failures  
**Resolution**: Used `-f` flag and continued - these directories are harmless

### Issue 2: Merge conflict in nuget.yml
**Problem**: File had unresolved merge conflict markers  
**Resolution**: Resolved conflict by choosing correct version and updating paths

### Issue 3: Duplicate test files
**Problem**: Some test files remained in old `/tests/` directory  
**Resolution**: Moved remaining files to appropriate new locations

---
